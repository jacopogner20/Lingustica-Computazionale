# Lingustica Computazionale

This repo contains the files .py and the txt files used for my exam of Linguistica Computazionale, taken in the year 2020 at the University of Pisa.
The exam involved the application of NLP techniques to two masterpieces of the English literature (chosen by me): Tess of the Durbevilles by Thomas Hardy and Great Expectations by Charles Dickens.
