I won’t walk another inch with you, if you say any jokes about him!” Tess cried, and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her face and neck.', 'Tess’s pride would not allow her to turn her head again, to learn what her father’s meaning was, if he had any; and thus she moved on with the whole body to the enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green.', 'Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion untinctured by experience.', 'He took almost the first that came to hand, which was not the speaker, as she had expected; nor did it happen to be Tess Durbeyfield.', 'Pedigree, ancestral skeletons, monumental record, the d’Urberville lineaments, did not help Tess in her life’s battle as yet, even to the extent of attracting to her a dancing-partner over the heads of the commonest peasantry.', 'As he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield, whose own large orbs wore, to tell the truth, the faintest aspect of reproach that he had not chosen her.', 'As for Tess Durbeyfield, she did not so easily dislodge the incident from her consideration.', 'So matters stood when Tess opened the door and paused upon the mat within it, surveying the scene.', 'There stood her mother amid the group of children, as Tess had left her, hanging over the Monday washing-tub, which had now, as always, lingered on to the end of the week.', 'Out of that tub had come the day before—Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse—the very white frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grass—which had been wrung up and ironed by her mother’s own hands.', 'No ditty floated into Blackmoor Vale from the outer world but Tess’s mother caught up its notation in a week.', 'There still faintly beamed from the woman’s features something of the freshness, and even the prettiness, of her youth; rendering it probable that the personal charms which Tess could boast of were in main part her mother’s gift, and therefore unknightly, unhistorical.', 'I thought you had finished long ago.”\n\nHer mother bore Tess no ill-will for leaving the housework to her single-handed efforts for so long; indeed, Joan seldom upbraided her thereon at any time, feeling but slightly the lack of Tess’s assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in postponing them.', '“Since I’ve been away?” Tess asked.', 'Your father learnt it on his way hwome from Shaston, and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter.”\n\n“Where is father now?” asked Tess suddenly.', '‘You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.’”\n\nTess looked alarmed.', 'He’ll have to start shortly after twelve to-night, as the distance is so long.”\n\n“Get up his strength!” said Tess impetuously, the tears welling to her eyes.', 'I have been waiting for ’ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him.”\n\n“I’ll go.”\n\n“O no, Tess.', 'You see, it would be no use.”\n\nTess did not expostulate.', 'Tess took it up, and her mother started.', 'Tess, being left alone with the younger children, went first to the outhouse with the fortune-telling book, and stuffed it into the thatch.', 'Returning along the garden path Tess mused on what the mother could have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day.', 'There was an interval of four years and more between Tess and the next of the family, the two who had filled the gap having died in their infancy, and this lent her a deputy-maternal attitude when she was alone with her juniors.', 'Tess looked out of the door, and took a mental journey through Marlott.', 'Tess began to perceive that a man in indifferent health, who proposed to start on a journey before one in the morning, ought not to be at an inn at this late hour celebrating his ancient blood.', '’Liza-Lu then went to bed, and Tess, locking them all in, started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and when one-handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day.', 'Mrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from Tess, opened the front door, crossed the downstairs room, which was in deep gloom, and then unfastened the stair-door like one whose fingers knew the tricks of the latches well.', '“And my projick is to send Tess to claim kin.”\n\n“There is a lady of the name, now you mention it,” said Durbeyfield.', '“And we’ll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with her;

and hardly was a reproachful flash from Tess’s dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their seats, hastily finish their ale, and descend the stairs behind her, Mrs Rolliver’s caution following their footsteps.', '’Night t’ye!”\n\nThey went home together, Tess holding one arm of her father, and Mrs Durbeyfield the other.', 'From your nater ’tis my belief you’ve disgraced yourselves more than any o’ us, and was kings and queens outright at one time.”\n\nTess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry—“I am afraid father won’t be able to take the journey with the beehives to-morrow so early.”\n\n“I?', 'At half-past one Mrs Durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where Tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept.', 'Tess sat up in bed, lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this information.', '“O no—I wouldn’t have it for the world!” declared Tess proudly.', 'Meanwhile Tess had hastily dressed herself; and the twain, lighting a lantern, went out to the stable.', '“Tess!” he said in a preparatory tone, after a silence.', '“Yes, Abraham.”\n\n“Bain’t you glad that we’ve become gentlefolk?”\n\n“Not particular glad.”\n\n“But you be glad that you ’m going to marry a gentleman?”\n\n“What?” said Tess, lifting her face.', 'If Tess were made rich by marrying a gentleman, would she have money enough to buy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as Nettlecombe-Tout?', 'The renewed subject, which seemed to have impregnated the whole family, filled Tess with impatience.', '“Did you say the stars were worlds, Tess?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“All like ours?”\n\n“I don’t know; but I think so.', 'Most of them splendid and sound—a few blighted.”\n\n“Which do we live on—a splendid one or a blighted one?”\n\n“A blighted one.”\n\n“’Tis very unlucky that we didn’t pitch on a sound one, when there were so many more of ’em!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Is it like that really, Tess?” said Abraham, turning to her much impressed, on reconsideration of this rare information.', 'Tess was not skilful in the management of a horse, but she thought that she could take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and allow Abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so.', 'With no longer a companion to distract her, Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever, her back leaning against the hives.', 'A sudden jerk shook her in her seat, and Tess awoke from the sleep into which she, too, had fallen.', 'In consternation Tess jumped down, and discovered the dreadful truth.', 'In her despair Tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole, with the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with the crimson drops.', 'It is getting daylight, and you have nothing to fear.”\n\nHe mounted and sped on his way; while Tess stood and waited.', 'The atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges, arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and Tess showed hers, still whiter.', '“To think that I was such a fool!”\n\n“’Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one, isn’t it, Tess?” murmured Abraham through his tears.', 'Tess had gone back earlier.', 'Nobody blamed Tess as she blamed herself.', 'All except Tess.', 'Tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents into this quagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it; and then her mother broached her scheme.', '“We must take the ups wi’ the downs, Tess,” said she; “and never could your high blood have been found out at a more called-for moment.', 'You must go to her and claim kin, and ask for some help in our trouble.”\n\n“I shouldn’t care to do that,” says Tess.', 'I’ve heard what I’ve heard, good-now.”\n\nThe oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish; but she could not understand why her mother should find such satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, such doubtful profit.', 'But Tess’s pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste to her.', '“I’m the head of the noblest branch o’ the family, and I ought to live up to it.”\n\nHis reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her own objections to going.', 'And don’t go thinking about her making a match for me—it is silly.”\n\n“Very well said, Tess!” observed her father sententiously.', 'Tess Durbeyfield’s route on this memorable morning lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born, and in which her life had unfolded.', 'In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex and age, and had used to be seen about the village as one of three—all nearly of the same year—walking home from school side by side; Tess the middle one—in a pink print pinafore, of a finely reticulated pattern, worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a nondescript tertiary—marching on upon long stalky legs, in tight stockings which had little ladder-like holes at the knees, torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral treasures; her then earth-coloured hair hanging like pot-hooks; the arms of the two outside girls resting round the waist of Tess; her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters.', 'As Tess grew older, and began to see how matters stood, she felt quite a Malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so many little sisters and brothers, when it was such a trouble to nurse and provide for them.', 'However, Tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones, and to help them as much as possible she used, as soon as she left school, to lend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring farms; or, by preference, at milking or butter-making processes, which she had learnt when her father had owned cows; and being deft-fingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled.', 'Every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the family burdens, and that Tess should be the representative of the Durbeyfields at the d’Urberville mansion came as a thing of course.', 'Tess thought this was the mansion itself till, passing through the side wicket with some trepidation, and onward to a point at which the drive took a turn, the house proper stood in full view.', 'Simple Tess Durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a half-alarmed attitude, on the edge of the gravel sweep.', 'Of this work of imagination poor Tess and her parents were naturally in ignorance—much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very possibility of such annexations was unknown to them; who supposed that, though to be well-favoured might be the gift of fortune, a family name came by nature.', 'Tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge, hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere, when a figure came forth from the dark triangular door of the tent.', 'Have you come to see me or my mother?”\n\nThis embodiment of a d’Urberville and a namesake differed even more from what Tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed.', 'Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem—”\n\nTess’s sense of a certain ludicrousness in her errand was now so strong that, notwithstanding her awe of him, and her general discomfort at being here, her rosy lips curved towards a smile, much to the attraction of the swarthy Alexander.', '“Mother asked me to come,” Tess continued; “and, indeed, I was in the mind to do so myself likewise.', 'And I, for one, don’t regret her step.” Alec looked at Tess as he spoke, in a way that made her blush a little.', '“And so, my pretty girl, you’ve come on a friendly visit to us, as relations?”\n\n“I suppose I have,” faltered Tess, looking uncomfortable again.', 'Supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty Coz?”\n\nTess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible; but the young man was pressing, and she consented to accompany him.', '“Yes,” said Tess, “when they come.”\n\n“They are already here.” D’Urberville began gathering specimens of the fruit for her, handing them back to her as he stooped; and, presently, selecting a specially fine product of the “British Queen” variety, he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth.', 'They had spent some time wandering desultorily thus, Tess eating in a half-pleased, half-reluctant state whatever d’Urberville offered her.', '“Oh, not at all, sir.”\n\nHe watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of smoke that pervaded the tent, and Tess Durbeyfield did not divine, as she innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom, that there behind the blue narcotic haze was potentially the “tragic mischief” of her drama—one who stood fair to be the blood-red ray in the spectrum of her young life.', '“Tess Durbeyfield, down at Marlott.”\n\n“And you say your people have lost their horse?”\n\n“I—killed him!” she answered, her eyes filling with tears as she gave particulars of Prince’s death.', 'But, Tess, no nonsense about ‘d’Urberville’;—‘Durbeyfield’ only, you know—quite another name.”\n\n“I wish for no better, sir,” said she with something of dignity.', 'And what a crumby girl!”  Tess went down the hill to Trantridge Cross, and inattentively waited to take her seat in the van returning from Chaseborough to Shaston.', 'Like all the cottagers in Blackmoor Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions; she thought this an ill omen—the first she had noticed that day.', 'Her mother had advised her to stay here for the night, at the house of a cottage-woman they knew, if she should feel too tired to come on; and this Tess did, not descending to her home till the following afternoon.', 'What has?” said Tess rather wearily.', 'Her mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval, and went on banteringly: “So you’ve brought ’em round!”\n\n“How do you know, mother?”\n\n“I’ve had a letter.”\n\nTess then remembered that there would have been time for this.', '“Well, he spoke to his mother, of course, and she do want ’ee there.”\n\n“But I don’t know that I am apt at tending fowls,” said the dubious Tess.', 'Besides, that’s only just a show of something for you to do, that you midn’t feel beholden.”\n\n“I don’t altogether think I ought to go,” said Tess thoughtfully.', '“Oh—that’s all!” said Tess.', '“You couldn’t expect her to throw her arms round ’ee, an’ to kiss and to coll ’ee all at once.”\n\nTess looked out of the window.', 'He had wished to know, finally, in the name of his mother, if Tess could really come to manage the old lady’s fowl-farm or not; the lad who had hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy.', 'He is very much interested in ’ee—truth to tell.”\n\nTess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won such high opinion from a stranger when, in her own esteem, she had sunk so low.', '“It is very good of him to think that,” she murmured; “and if I was quite sure how it would be living there, I would go any-when.”\n\n“He is a mighty handsome man!”\n\n“I don’t think so,” said Tess coldly.', '“I’ll think it over,” said Tess, leaving the room.', 'Tess, the little rogue!', 'And have she really paid ’em a visit to such an end as this?”\n\nMeanwhile Tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry-bushes in the garden, and over Prince’s grave.', '“I wish I had seen Mrs d’Urberville,” said Tess.', 'But—but—I don’t quite like Mr d’Urberville being there!”\n\nThe children, who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by their wealthy kinsfolk (which they imagined the other family to be) as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began to cry at Tess’s reluctance, and teased and reproached her for hesitating.', '“Tess won’t go-o-o and be made a la-a-dy of!—no, she says she wo-o-on’t!” they wailed, with square mouths.', 'And Tess won’t look pretty in her best cloze no mo-o-ore!”\n\nHer mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she had of making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them indefinitely, also weighed in the argument.', '“I will go,” said Tess at last.', 'For such a pretty maid as ’tis, this is a fine chance!”\n\nTess smiled crossly.', '“It might have been a carriage for her own kin!”\n\nHaving at last taken her course Tess was less restless and abstracted, going about her business with some self-assurance in the thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not be onerous.', 'On the morning appointed for her departure Tess was awake before dawn—at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute, save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear-voiced conviction that he at least knows the correct time of day, the rest preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken.', '“You will never set out to see your folks without dressing up more the dand than that?”\n\n“But I am going to work!” said Tess.', '“Very well; I suppose you know best,” replied Tess with calm abandonment.', 'First she fetched a great basin, and washed Tess’s hair with such thoroughness that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as at other times.', 'Then she put upon her the white frock that Tess had worn at the club-walking, the airy fulness of which, supplementing her enlarged coiffure, imparted to her developing figure an amplitude which belied her age, and might cause her to be estimated as a woman when she was not much more than a child.', '“I declare there’s a hole in my stocking-heel!” said Tess.', '“It is much better than you was t’other day.”\n\nAs the looking-glass was only large enough to reflect a very small portion of Tess’s person at one time, Mrs Durbeyfield hung a black cloak outside the casement, and so made a large reflector of the panes, as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do.', 'But whatever you do, don’t zay too much to Tess of his fancy for her, and this chance she has got.', 'At the top Tess was going to be met with the spring-cart sent by the Stoke-d’Urbervilles, and her box had already been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in readiness.', '“I do want to walk a little-ways wi’ Sissy, now she’s going to marry our gentleman-cousin, and wear fine cloze!”\n\n“Now,” said Tess, flushing and turning quickly, “I’ll hear no more o’ that!', '“Goodbye, father,” said Tess, with a lumpy throat.', 'And tell’n, Tess, that being sunk, quite, from our former grandeur, I’ll sell him the title—yes, sell it—and at no onreasonable figure.”\n\n“Not for less than a thousand pound!” cried Lady Durbeyfield.', 'Dammy, family honour is family honour, and I won’t take a penny less!”\n\nTess’s eyes were too full and her voice too choked to utter the sentiments that were in her.', 'So the girls and their mother all walked together, a child on each side of Tess, holding her hand and looking at her meditatively from time to time, as at one who was about to do great things; her mother just behind with the smallest; the group forming a picture of honest beauty flanked by innocence, and backed by simple-souled vanity.', 'Nobody was visible in the elevated road which skirted the ascent save the lad whom they had sent on before them, sitting on the handle of the barrow that contained all Tess’s worldly possessions.', 'Her mother and the children thereupon decided to go no farther, and bidding them a hasty goodbye, Tess bent her steps up the hill.', 'But before she had quite reached it another vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit, came round the bend of the road there, passed the luggage-cart, and halted beside Tess, who looked up as if in great surprise.', 'The driver was a young man of three- or four-and-twenty, with a cigar between his teeth; wearing a dandy cap, drab jacket, breeches of the same hue, white neckcloth, stick-up collar, and brown driving-gloves—in short, he was the handsome, horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before to get her answer about Tess.', 'Meanwhile the muslined form of Tess could be seen standing still, undecided, beside this turn-out, whose owner was talking to her.', 'Directly Tess was out of sight, and the interest of the matter as a drama was at an end, the little ones’ eyes filled with tears.', 'The youngest child said, “I wish poor, poor Tess wasn’t gone away to be a lady!” and, lowering the corners of his lips, burst out crying.', '“I was thinking that perhaps it would ha’ been better if Tess had not gone.”\n\n“Oughtn’t ye to have thought of that before?”\n\n“Well, ’tis a chance for the maid—Still, if ’twere the doing again, I wouldn’t let her go till I had found out whether the gentleman is really a good-hearted young man and choice over her as his kinswoman.”\n\n“Yes, you ought, perhaps, to ha’ done that,” snored Sir John.', 'Her d’Urberville blood, you mean?”\n\n“No, stupid; her face—as ’twas mine.”  Having mounted beside her, Alec d’Urberville drove rapidly along the crest of the first hill, chatting compliments to Tess as they went, the cart with her box being left far behind.', 'Ever since the accident with her father’s horse Tess Durbeyfield, courageous as she naturally was, had been exceedingly timid on wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her.', '“Why, Tess,” he answered, after another whiff or two, “it isn’t a brave bouncing girl like you who asks that?', 'Didn’t you notice it?”\n\n“Don’t try to frighten me, sir,” said Tess stiffly.', 'The wind blew through Tess’s white muslin to her very skin, and her washed hair flew out behind.', '“Tess—fie!', '“No, no!” said Tess.', 'D’Urberville turned his face to her as they rocked, and said, in playful raillery: “Now then, put your arms round my waist again, as you did before, my Beauty.”\n\n“Never!” said Tess independently, holding on as well as she could without touching him.', '“Let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips, Tess, or even on that warmed cheek, and I’ll stop—on my honour, I will!”\n\nTess, surprised beyond measure, slid farther back still on her seat, at which he urged the horse anew, and rocked her the more.', '“Nothing, dear Tess,” he replied.', '“So you can go from your word like that, you young witch, can you?”\n\n“Very well,” said Tess, “I’ll not move since you be so determined!', 'Tess made no reply to this remark, of which, indeed, she did not quite comprehend the drift, unheeding the snub she had administered by her instinctive rub upon her cheek.', 'D’Urberville pulled up, and said he would get it for her, but Tess was down on the other side.', 'What’s the matter?”\n\nThe hat was in place and tied, but Tess had not stepped forward.', '“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words!” cried Tess with spirit, from the top of the hedge into which she had scrambled.', 'My life upon it now!”\n\nStill Tess could not be induced to remount.', 'A few minutes later the chimneys of The Slopes appeared in view, and in a snug nook to the right the poultry-farm and cottage of Tess’s destination.', 'The community of fowls to which Tess had been appointed as supervisor, purveyor, nurse, surgeon, and friend made its headquarters in an old thatched cottage standing in an enclosure that had once been a garden, but was now a trampled and sanded square.', 'When Tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in altering and improving the arrangements, according to her skilled ideas as the daughter of a professed poulterer, the door in the wall opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered.', '“Mrs d’Urberville wants the fowls as usual,” she said; but perceiving that Tess did not quite understand, she explained, “Mis’ess is a old lady, and blind.”\n\n“Blind!” said Tess.', 'Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges—one sitting on each arm.', 'But they will soon get used to you.”\n\nWhile the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in obedience to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap, and she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks, their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws.', 'It reminded Tess of a Confirmation, in which Mrs d’Urberville was the bishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the maid-servant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up.', 'At the end of the ceremony Mrs d’Urberville abruptly asked Tess, wrinkling and twitching her face into undulations, “Can you whistle?”\n\n“Whistle, Ma’am?”\n\n“Yes, whistle tunes.”\n\nTess could whistle like most other country-girls, though the accomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel company.', 'Thus the reception of Tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated, and the birds were taken back to their quarters.', 'In spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before, Tess inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the morning when the sun shone, now that she was once installed there; and she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction asked of her, so as to ascertain her chance of retaining her post.', '“Upon my honour!” cried he, “there was never before such a beautiful thing in Nature or Art as you look, ‘Cousin’ Tess (‘Cousin’ had a faint ring of mockery).', 'Well then—I’ll give you a lesson or two.”\n\n“Oh no, you won’t!” said Tess, withdrawing towards the door.', 'There ’tis—so.”\n\nHe suited the action to the word, and whistled a line of “Take, O take those lips away.” But the allusion was lost upon Tess.', 'He encouraged her with “Try again!”\n\nTess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she tried—ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound.', 'There—I said I would not come near you; and, in spite of such temptation as never before fell to mortal man, I’ll keep my word.... Tess, do you think my mother a queer old soul?”\n\n“I don’t know much of her yet, sir.”\n\n“You’ll find her so; she must be, to make you learn to whistle to her bullfinches.', 'If you meet with any difficulties and want help here, don’t go to the bailiff, come to me.”\n\nIt was in the economy of this régime that Tess Durbeyfield had undertaken to fill a place.', 'Once while Tess was at the window where the cages were ranged, giving her lesson as usual, she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed.', 'For a long time Tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages.', 'But under pressure from matrons not much older than herself—for a field-man’s wages being as high at twenty-one as at forty, marriage was early here—Tess at length consented to go.', 'Tess’s occupations made her late in setting out, so that her comrades reached the town long before her.', 'Through this low-lit mistiness Tess walked leisurely along.', 'It was a windowless erection used for storage, and from the open door there floated into the obscurity a mist of yellow radiance, which at first Tess thought to be illuminated smoke.', 'So we come here and send out for liquor.”\n\n“But when be any of you going home?” asked Tess with some anxiety.', 'This surely would end it, thought Tess.', 'A loud laugh from behind Tess’s back, in the shade of the garden, united with the titter within the room.', 'I have only a saddle-horse here to-day; but come to The Flower-de-Luce, and I’ll hire a trap, and drive you home with me.”\n\nTess, though flattered, had never quite got over her original mistrust of him, and, despite their tardiness, she preferred to walk home with the work-folk.', 'Tess soon perceived as she walked in the flock, sometimes with this one, sometimes with that, that the fresh night air was producing staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too freely; some of the more careless women also were wandering in their gait—to wit, a dark virago, Car Darch, dubbed Queen of Spades, till lately a favourite of d’Urberville’s; Nancy, her sister, nicknamed the Queen of Diamonds;

“and if I had known you was of that sort, I wouldn’t have so let myself down as to come with such a whorage as this is!”\n\nThe rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of vituperation from other quarters upon fair Tess’s unlucky head, particularly from the Queen of Diamonds, who having stood in the relations to d’Urberville that Car had also been suspected of, united with the latter against the common enemy.', 'Thereupon, finding Tess unfairly browbeaten, the husbands and lovers tried to make peace by defending her;

also Mr Clare, Jonathan Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood gazing hopelessly at the churn; and the boy who kept the horse going outside put on moon-like eyes to show his sense of the situation.', 'O yes, I shall have to go to ’n, if this sort of thing continnys!”\n\nEven Mr Clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman’s desperation.', 'I can mind all about it—’twas the damage to the churn.”\n\nHe turned to Clare.', 'He went forward and opened the door for her, saying with tender raillery—\n\n“Why, maidy” (he frequently, with unconscious irony, gave her this pet name), “the prettiest milker I’ve got in my dairy; you mustn’t get so fagged as this at the first breath of summer weather, or we shall be finely put to for want of ’ee by dog-days, shan’t we, Mr Clare?”\n\n“I was faint—and—I think I am better out o’ doors,” she said mechanically; and disappeared outside.', 'Dear eyes—dear face—dear Mr Clare!”\n\n“There—you’ve owned it!”\n\n“So have you—so have we all,” said Marian, with the dry frankness of complete indifference to opinion.', 'But the unconscious Mr Clare had gone indoors, and they saw him no more; and, the shades beginning to deepen, they crept into their beds.', 'Being more finely formed, better educated, and, though the youngest except Retty, more woman than either, she perceived that only the slightest ordinary care was necessary for holding her own in Angel Clare’s heart against these her candid friends.', 'Such unequal attachments had led to marriage; and she had heard from Mrs Crick that Mr Clare had one day asked, in a laughing way, what would be the use of his marrying a fine lady, and all the while ten thousand acres of Colonial pasture to feed, and cattle to rear, and corn to reap.', 'But whether Mr Clare had spoken seriously or not, why should she, who could never conscientiously allow any man to marry her now, and who had religiously determined that she never would be tempted to do so, draw off Mr Clare’s attention from other women, for the brief happiness of sunning herself in his eyes while he remained at Talbothays?', '“Yes—taste for yourself!”\n\nSeveral of them gathered round him; and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted, also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table.', 'However, they formed themselves into line, all assisting, owing to the importance of the search; the dairyman at the upper end with Mr Clare, who had volunteered to help; then Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and the married dairywomen—Beck Knibbs, with her wooly black hair and rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances, consumptive from the winter damps of the water-meads—who lived in their respective cottages.', 'Angel Clare, who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part with the rest in everything, glanced up now and then.', 'Mr Clare also stepped out of line, and began privateering about for the weed.', 'I have often thought so.”\n\n“Though, poor dears, prettiness won’t last long!”\n\n“O no, unfortunately.”\n\n“They are excellent dairywomen.”\n\n“Yes: though not better than you.”\n\n“They skim better than I.”\n\n“Do they?”\n\nClare remained observing them—not without their observing him.', 'Why it that?”\n\n“Because you are looking at her.”\n\nSelf-sacrificing as her mood might be, Tess could not well go further and cry, “Marry one of them, if you really do want a dairywoman and not a lady; and don’t think of marrying me!” She followed Dairyman Crick, and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that Clare remained behind.', 'Tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that Angel Clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping, and her perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of either in the least degree bred a tender respect in Tess for what she deemed, rightly or wrongly, the self-controlling sense of duty shown by him, a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the opposite sex, and in the absence of which more than one of the simple hearts who were his house-mates might have gone weeping on her pilgrimage.', '“And I do colour up so hot, walking into church late, and all the people staring round,” said Marian, “that I hardly cool down again till we get into the That-it-may-please-Thees.”\n\nWhile they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round the bend of the road, and presently appeared Angel Clare, advancing along the lane towards them through the water.', '“A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now going to be mine.”\n\n“Fie—it is Scripture, Izz!”\n\n“Yes,” said Izz, “I’ve always a’ ear at church for pretty verses.”\n\nAngel Clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz.', 'Poor little Retty, though by far the lightest weight, was the most troublesome of Clare’s burdens.', 'She was embarrassed to discover that excitement at the proximity of Mr Clare’s breath and eyes, which she had contemned in her companions, was intensified in herself; and as if fearful of betraying her secret, she paltered with him at the last moment.', 'You must be so tired, Mr Clare!”\n\n“No, no, Tess,” said he quickly.', 'Clare stood still and inclinced his face towards hers.', 'There was no concealing from herself the fact that she loved Angel Clare, perhaps all the more passionately from knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him.', 'After this disclosure Tess nourished no further foolish thought that there lurked any grave and deliberate import in Clare’s attentions to her.', 'And as Clare was oppressed by the outward heats, so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for the soft and silent Tess.', 'When she rose from her stool under a finished cow, Angel Clare, who had been observing her for some time, asked her if she would take the aforesaid creatures next.', 'She did not know that Clare had followed her round, and that he sat under his cow watching her.', 'Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could reproduce them mentally with ease: and now, as they again confronted him, clothed with colour and life, they sent an aura over his flesh, a breeze through his nerves, which well nigh produced a qualm; and actually produced, by some mysterious physiological process, a prosaic sneeze.', 'The influence that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the sky did not die down.', '“She is angry—she doesn’t know what we mean—she’ll kick over the milk!” exclaimed Tess, gently striving to free herself, her eyes concerned with the quadruped’s actions, her heart more deeply concerned with herself and Clare.', 'Clare, restless, went out into the dusk when evening drew on, she who had won him having retired to her chamber.', 'Every window of the house being open, Clare could hear across the yard each trivial sound of the retiring household.', 'Despite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man with a conscience.', 'One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some maid observed that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day.', '“Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster to spend a few days wi’ his kinsfolk.”\n\nFor four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning went out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song.', 'At this moment of the morning Angel Clare was riding along a narrow lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of his father’s Vicarage at Emminster, carrying, as well as he could, a little basket which contained some black-puddings and a bottle of mead, sent by Mrs Crick, with her kind respects, to his parents.', 'Clare knew her well.', 'Clare’s mind flew to the impassioned, summer-steeped heathens in the Var Vale, their rosy faces court-patched with cow-droppings; and to one the most impassioned of them all.', 'Old Mr Clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty years, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life.', 'On their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing divergence from the Angel Clare of former times.', 'Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare; though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions.', 'you are looking for the black-puddings, my dear boy,” observed Clare’s mother.', 'She is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me directly I return.”\n\n“You cannot, if we did not,” Mr Clare answered lucidly.', 'When the service was over they went out of the room with their mother, and Mr Clare and himself were left alone.', '“As far as worldly wealth goes,” continued his father, “you will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.”\n\nThis considerateness on old Mr Clare’s part led Angel onward to the other and dearer subject.', 'It would be desirable.” Mr Clare, the elder, had plainly never thought of these points before.', 'In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice.', '“Pernicious!” said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea.', 'Some of the wise even among themselves ‘exclaim against their own succession,’ as Hamlet puts it; but lyrically, dramatically, and even historically, I am tenderly attached to them.”\n\nThis distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too subtle for Mr Clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had been about to relate; which was that after the death of the senior so-called d’Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable passions, though he had a blind mother, whose condition should have made him know better.', 'A knowledge of his career having come to the ears of Mr Clare, when he was in that part of the country preaching missionary sermons, he boldly took occasion to speak to the delinquent on his spiritual state.', 'Though he was a stranger, occupying another’s pulpit, he had felt this to be his duty, and took for his text the words from St Luke: “Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee!” The young man much resented this directness of attack, and in the war of words which followed when they met he did not scruple publicly to insult Mr Clare, without respect for his gray hairs.', '“But I fear otherwise, from what you say.”\n\n“We’ll hope, nevertheless,” said Mr Clare.', 'But, after all, one of those poor words of mine may spring up in his heart as a good seed some day.”\n\nNow, as always, Clare’s father was sanguine as a child; and though the younger could not accept his parent’s narrow dogma, he revered his practice and recognized the hero under the pietist.', 'Clare was now so familiar with the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long distance off, he saw them dotted about the meads.', 'Three was the afternoon skimming-hour; and, with the stroke, Clare heard the creaking of the floor-boards above, and then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs.', 'With an oddly compounded look of gladness, shyness, and surprise, she exclaimed—“O Mr Clare!', 'How you frightened me—I—”\n\nThere had not at first been time for her to think of the changed relations which his declaration had introduced; but the full sense of the matter rose up in her face when she encountered Clare’s tender look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair.', '“I have come back, Deborah,” said Mr Clare, upwards.', 'She had bowed to the inevitable result of proximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her without quite meaning himself to do it so soon.', '“O Mr Clare—I cannot be your wife—I cannot be!”\n\nThe sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess’s very heart, and she bowed her face in her grief.', 'Not to agitate and hinder her longer, the considerate Clare began talking in a more general way:\n\n“You quite misapprehend my parents.', 'Tessy, are you an Evangelical?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“You go to church very regularly, and our parson here is not very High, they tell me.”\n\nTess’s ideas on the views of the parish clergyman, whom she heard every week, seemed to be rather more vague than Clare’s, who had never heard him at all.', 'Clare’s revived thoughts of his father prevented his noticing her particularly;

for your sake, I say no!”\n\n“Tess!”\n\n“Still I say no!” she repeated.', 'In this way Clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of the purling milk—at the cow’s side, at skimmings, at butter-makings, at cheese-makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs—as no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man.', 'The dairy had again worked by morning candlelight for a long time;

and you were so good as to own that long ago.”\n\n“Very well, then, ‘Angel dearest’, if I must,” she murmured, looking at her candle, a roguish curl coming upon her mouth, notwithstanding her suspense.', 'Clare had resolved never to kiss her until he had obtained her promise; but somehow, as Tess stood there in her prettily tucked-up milking gown, her hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done, he broke his resolve, and brought his lips to her cheek for one moment.', 'Who’ll drive it across?”\n\nMr Clare volunteered to do so, though it was none of his business, asking Tess to accompany him.', 'She therefore replied by glancing over her scant habiliments; but Clare gently urged her.', 'She assented by relinquishing her pail and stool to the dairyman to take home, and mounted the spring-waggon beside Clare.', 'Tess held it from slipping off him as well as herself, Clare’s hands being occupied.', '“Of course,” continued the unwitting Clare, “I should have been glad to know you to be descended exclusively from the long-suffering, dumb, unrecorded rank and file of the English nation, and not from the self-seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of the rest.', '“Will this prove it more?”\n\nShe clasped his neck, and for the first time Clare learnt what an impassioned woman’s kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she loved with all her heart and soul, as Tess loved him.', 'There was hardly a touch of earth in her love for Clare.', 'Angel Clare was far from all that she thought him in this respect; absurdly far, indeed; but he was, in truth, more spiritual than animal; he had himself well in hand, and was singularly free from grossness.', 'This amazed and enraptured Tess, whose slight experiences had been so infelicitous till now; and in her reaction from indignation against the male sex she swerved to excess of honour for Clare.', 'The country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during betrothal was the only custom she knew, and to her it had no strangeness; though it seemed oddly anticipative to Clare till he saw how normal a thing she, in common with all the other dairy-folk, regarded it.', 'The sun was so near the ground, and the sward so flat, that the shadows of Clare and Tess would stretch a quarter of a mile ahead of them, like two long fingers pointing afar to where the green alluvial reaches abutted against the sloping sides of the vale.', 'Clare hardily kept his arm round her waist in sight of these watermen, with the air of a man who was accustomed to public dalliance, though actually as shy as she who, with lips parted and eyes askance on the labourers, wore the look of a wary animal the while.', '“O no!”\n\n“But if it should reach the ears of your friends at Emminster that you are walking about like this with me, a milkmaid—”\n\n“The most bewitching milkmaid ever seen.”\n\n“They might feel it a hurt to their dignity.”\n\n“My dear girl—a d’Urberville hurt the dignity of a Clare!', 'One evening Tess and Clare were obliged to sit indoors keeping house, all the other occupants of the domicile being away.', 'Clare, deeming the whole basis of her excitement to be that which was only the smaller part of it, said—\n\n“I won’t have you speak like it, dear Tess!', '“No, Angel, I am not really so—by nature, I mean!” The more particularly to assure him that she was not, she placed herself close to him in the settle, and allowed her head to find a resting-place against Clare’s shoulder.', 'O no, I should never ha’ thought a word of where she was a sitting to, if she hadn’t told me—not I.”\n\n“We are going to be married soon,” said Clare, with improvised phlegm.', 'You be proud, I’m sure!”\n\n“Yes, I am,” she said; “and I am ashamed at so breaking down.”\n\nWhen they were all in bed, and the light was out, Marian whispered across to her—\n\n“You will think of us when you be his wife, Tess, and of how we told ’ee that we loved him, and how we tried not to hate you, and did not hate you, and could not hate you, because you were his choice, and we never hoped to be chose by him.”\n\nThey were not aware that, at these words, salt, stinging tears trickled down upon Tess’s pillow anew, and how she resolved, with a bursting heart, to tell all her history to Angel Clare, despite her mother’s command—to let him for whom she lived and breathed despise her if he would, and her mother regard her as a fool, rather then preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him, and which somehow seemed a wrong to these.', '“It seems like tens of thousands of them,” said Tess; “holding public-meetings in their market-places, arguing, preaching, quarrelling, sobbing, groaning, praying, and cursing.”\n\nClare was not particularly heeding.', 'To decline to marry him after all—in obedience to her emotion of last night—and leave the dairy, meant to go to some strange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in request now calving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm where no divine being like Angel Clare was.', 'Despite Angel Clare’s plausible representation to himself and to Tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a later date.', 'Clare paid a visit to the place, some few miles distant, one day at this time, to inquire particulars, and returned to Talbothays in the evening.', 'This was always how Clare settled practical questions; by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them.', '“Have ye forgot ’em, Mr Clare?', 'The banns, I mean.”\n\n“No, I have not forgot ’em,” says Clare.', 'Clare’s life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the world of his own class.', 'Clare had just returned from the stable-yard, and, confronting the man on the threshold, heard the words, and saw the shrinking of Tess.', 'The man recovered himself, and seemed inclined to come on, and Clare, stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence.', 'He looked anew at Tess as he passed her, and said to Clare—\n\n“I beg pardon, sir; ’twas a complete mistake.', 'I thought she was another woman, forty miles from here.”\n\nClare, feeling then that he had been too hasty, and that he was, moreover, to blame for leaving her standing in an inn-passage, did what he usually did in such cases, gave the man five shillings to plaster the blow; and thus they parted, bidding each other a pacific good night.', 'As soon as Clare had taken the reins from the ostler, and the young couple had driven off, the two men went in the other direction.', 'But she was grave, very grave, all the way home; till she thought, “We shall go away, a very long distance, hundreds of miles from these parts, and such as this can never happen again, and no ghost of the past reach there.”\n\nThey parted tenderly that night on the landing, and Clare ascended to his attic.', 'Everybody else in the house was asleep, and in her anxiety lest Clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door, and asked him what was the matter.', 'She sat down and wrote on the four pages of a note-sheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four years ago, put it into an envelope, and directed it to Clare.', 'This coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long.', 'It had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare’s den, or rather eyrie, for so long, and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment, regarding and pondering.', 'The only minute Tess could get to be alone with Clare was when they met upon the landing.', 'She was a sort of celestial person, who owed her being to poetry—one of those classical divinities Clare was accustomed to talk to her about when they took their walks together.', 'Clare knew that she loved him—every curve of her form showed that—but he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion, its single-mindedness, its meekness; what long-suffering it guaranteed, what honesty, what endurance, what good faith.', '“I fancy you seem oppressed, Tessy,” said Clare.', 'She was Mrs Angel Clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name?', 'She impulsively whispered to him—\n\n“Will you kiss ’em all, once, poor things, for the first and last time?”\n\nClare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality—which was all that it was to him—and as he passed them he kissed them in succession where they stood, saying “Goodbye” to each as he did so.', 'Of all this Clare was unconscious.', 'The cock crew again—straight towards Clare.', '“Welcome to one of your ancestral mansions!” said Clare as he handed her down.', '“Whose portraits are those?” asked Clare of the charwoman.', 'Clare touched hers under the water.', '“That cock knew the weather was going to change,” said Clare.', 'Ah, there he is!”\n\nA knock had come to the door, and, there being nobody else to answer it, Clare went out.', 'Clare brought it to the light.', 'It was less than a foot long, sewed up in canvas, sealed in red wax with his father’s seal, and directed in his father’s hand to “Mrs Angel Clare.”\n\n“It is a little wedding-present for you, Tess,” said he, handing it to her.', 'The note was for Clare, in the following words:\n\nMy dear son,—\n    Possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your godmother, Mrs Pitney, when you were a lad, she—vain, kind woman that she was—left to me a portion of the contents of her jewel-case in trust for your wife, if you should ever have one, as a mark of her affection for you and whomsoever you should choose.', '“I do remember,” said Clare;

a peasant girl but very moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her simple condition and attire will bloom as an amazing beauty if clothed as a woman of fashion with the aids that Art can render; while the beauty of the midnight crush would often cut but a sorry figure if placed inside the field-woman’s wrapper upon a monotonous acreage of turnips on a dull day.', 'She did not speak, and Clare went on—\n\n“I did not mention it because I was afraid of endangering my chance of you, darling, the great prize of my life—my Fellowship I call you.', 'Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire; the intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him.', 'Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her of what had happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of the disclosure itself.', 'She was soon close at his heels, for Clare walked slowly and without purpose.', 'Clare turned at hearing her footsteps, but his recognition of her presence seemed to make no difference to him, and he went on over the five yawning arches of the great bridge in front of the house.', 'Away from the house the road wound through the meads, and along these she followed Clare without any attempt to come up with him or to attract him, but with dumb and vacant fidelity.', 'The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great after enlightenment, and it was mighty in Clare now.', 'She could not help addressing Clare.', 'Later on that night Clare also retraced his steps to the house.', '“Thank God!” murmured Clare;

the sense of disappointment remained with her yet.', 'Hence as Tess stirred the clods and sang her foolish little songs with scarce now a hope that Clare would ever hear them, she did not for a long time notice the person who worked nearest to her—a man in a long smockfrock who, she found, was forking the same plot as herself, and whom she supposed her father had sent there to advance the work.', 'Her husband, Angel Clare himself, had, like others, dealt out hard measure to her;

that his widow and children had left Marlott, declaring that they were going to live at Kingsbere, but instead of doing so had gone on to another place they mentioned.', 'By this time Clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain Tess, and hastened away from its hated presence without once looking back.', 'Some man, apparently the sexton, had observed Clare standing there, and drew nigh.', 'Bless your soul, sir, why—there, I wouldn’t wish to say it everywhere, but—even this headstone, for all the flourish wrote upon en, is not paid for.”\n\n“Ah, who put it up?”\n\nThe man told the name of a mason in the village, and, on leaving the churchyard, Clare called at the mason’s house.', 'The distance was too long for a walk, but Clare felt such a strong desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually reach the place.', 'This was the first time that Clare had ever met her, but he was too preoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman, in the garb of a respectable widow.', '“Go inside.”\n\nClare saw her efforts for reticence, and asked—\n\n“Do you think Tess would wish me to try and find her?', '“We are fairly well provided for.”\n\nWithout entering the house Clare turned away.', 'The last train to Sandbourne left shortly after, and it bore Clare on its wheels.', 'This fashionable watering-place, with its eastern and its western stations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its covered gardens, was, to Angel Clare, like a fairy place suddenly created by the stroke of a wand, and allowed to get a little dusty.', '“Do you know the address of a Mrs Clare?” asked Angel.', 'Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name, Clare said—\n\n“Of a Miss Durbeyfield?”\n\n“Durbeyfield?”\n\nThis also was strange to the postman addressed.', '“That’s it!” cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation.', '’Tis all lodging-houses here, bless ’ee.”\n\nClare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither, arriving with the milkman.', 'Clare inquired for Teresa d’Urberville or Durbeyfield.', 'He—”\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“He has won me back to him.”\n\nClare looked at her keenly, then, gathering her meaning, flagged like one plague-stricken, and his glance sank; it fell on her hands, which, once rosy, were now white and more delicate.', '“Ah—it is my fault!” said Clare.', 'Nevertheless, the visit of Angel Clare to her well-paying tenants, Mr and Mrs d’Urberville, as she deemed them, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade.', 'She heard Tess re-ascend the stairs to the first floor, and the departure of Clare, and the closing of the front door behind him.', 'Meanwhile Angel Clare had walked automatically along the way by which he had come, and, entering his hotel, sat down over the breakfast, staring at nothingness.', 'Clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station;

and then Angel put the question—\n\n“What kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hard-working farmer?”\n\n“A truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in your goings-out and your comings-in.', 'But, father, don’t you think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant, but one who, in place of that lady’s ecclesiastical accomplishments, understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself, would suit me infinitely better?”\n\nHis father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer’s wife’s duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father’s feelings and to advance the cause of his heart at the same time, grew specious.', '“She is not what in common parlance is called a lady,” said Angel, unflinchingly, “for she is a cottager’s daughter, as I am proud to say.', 'But she is a lady, nevertheless—in feeling and nature.”\n\n“Mercy Chant is of a very good family.”\n\n“Pooh!—what’s the advantage of that, mother?” said Angel quickly.', 'She lives what paper-poets only write... And she is an unimpeachable Christian, I am sure; perhaps of the very tribe, genus, and species you desire to propagate.”\n\n“O Angel, you are mocking!”\n\n“Mother, I beg pardon.', 'But as she really does attend Church almost every Sunday morning, and is a good Christian girl, I am sure you will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality, and feel that I may do worse than choose her.” Angel waxed quite earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess which (never dreaming that it might stand him in such good stead) he had been prone to slight when observing it practised by her and the other milkmaids, because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially naturalistic.', 'In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice.', 'Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now.', 'Angel might have accompanied them, but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at Talbothays.', 'Having fairly well advanced his own affairs, Angel listened in a willing silence, as they jogged on together through the shady lanes, to his father’s account of his parish difficulties, and the coldness of brother clergymen whom he loved, because of his strict interpretations of the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious Calvinistic doctrine.', 'I thought you set less store by them even than I.”\n\n“You misapprehend me, father; you often do,” said Angel with a little impatience.', 'Angel flushed with distress.', 'I have saved them from the guilt of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby; and they have lived to thank me, and praise God.”\n\n“May this young man do the same!” said Angel fervently.', 'The same unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel’s getting a living as a farmer, and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel admired it none the less.', 'Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel often felt that he was nearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren.', 'Angel entered, and went through the silent passages of the house to the back quarters, where he listened for a moment.', '“It is often a great sorrow to me.”\n\nShe spoke so unaffectedly that Angel was sure in his heart that his father could not object to her on religious grounds, even though she did not know whether her principles were High, Low or Broad.', 'Angel, who was filling the vats with his handful, suddenly ceased, and laid his hands flat upon hers.', 'Thursday came, and Angel looked thoughtfully at her from a distance, but intruded in no way upon her.', '“And had he married the valiant matron’s daughter, as he promised?” asked Angel Clare absently, as he turned over the newspaper he was reading at the little table to which he was always banished by Mrs Crick, in her sense of his gentility.', 'But Angel said no more; his face was perplexed; he went away.', '“Call me Angel, then, and not Mr Clare.”\n\n“Angel.”\n\n“Angel dearest—why not?”\n\n“’Twould mean that I agree, wouldn’t it?”\n\n“It would only mean that you love me, even if you cannot marry me; and you were so good as to own that long ago.”\n\n“Very well, then, ‘Angel dearest’, if I must,” she murmured, looking at her candle, a roguish curl coming upon her mouth, notwithstanding her suspense.', 'Every now and then Angel would fling the lash of his whip round one of these, pluck it off, and give it to his companion.', 'What an odd coincidence!”\n\n“Angel, I think I would rather not take the name!', 'Angel Clare was far from all that she thought him in this respect; absurdly far, indeed; but he was, in truth, more spiritual than animal; he had himself well in hand, and was singularly free from grossness.', 'Angel began to comfort and reassure her, thinking to himself, truly enough, what a creature of moods she was, and how careful he would have to be of her when she depended for her happiness entirely on him.', '“No, Angel, I am not really so—by nature, I mean!” The more particularly to assure him that she was not, she placed herself close to him in the settle, and allowed her head to find a resting-place against Clare’s shoulder.', 'You be proud, I’m sure!”\n\n“Yes, I am,” she said; “and I am ashamed at so breaking down.”\n\nWhen they were all in bed, and the light was out, Marian whispered across to her—\n\n“You will think of us when you be his wife, Tess, and of how we told ’ee that we loved him, and how we tried not to hate you, and did not hate you, and could not hate you, because you were his choice, and we never hoped to be chose by him.”\n\nThey were not aware that, at these words, salt, stinging tears trickled down upon Tess’s pillow anew, and how she resolved, with a bursting heart, to tell all her history to Angel Clare, despite her mother’s command—to let him for whom she lived and breathed despise her if he would, and her mother regard her as a fool, rather then preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him, and which somehow seemed a wrong to these.', 'I am afraid I was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this way forcing your hand.”\n\n“I don’t think you ought to have felt glad, Angel.', 'To decline to marry him after all—in obedience to her emotion of last night—and leave the dairy, meant to go to some strange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in request now calving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm where no divine being like Angel Clare was.', '“Angel, I will fix the day when I will become yours for always!”\n\nThus at last it was arranged between them, during that dark walk home, amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left.', 'Despite Angel Clare’s plausible representation to himself and to Tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a later date.', 'Izz mentioned the omission of the banns to Mrs Crick, and Mrs Crick assumed a matron’s privilege of speaking to Angel on the point.', 'Angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the wedding, somewhere away from the dairy, as a last jaunt in her company while there were yet mere lover and mistress; a romantic day, in circumstances that would never be repeated; with that other and greater day beaming close ahead of them.', 'In the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up, and Tess waited in the entry while Angel went to see the horse and gig brought to the door.', 'While she sat she heard a noise in Angel’s room overhead, a sound of thumping and struggling.', 'As for Angel’s family, he had written and duly informed them of the time, and assured them that he would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come.', 'Her perception that Angel’s bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own communication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it.', 'Angel would have liked one at least of his brothers to be present as groomsman, but their silence after his gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified that they did not care to come.', 'She knew that Angel was close to her; all the rest was a luminous mist.', 'It is all so serious, Angel.', '“Is it when we are going to die, Angel, that members of my family see it, or is it when we have committed a crime?”\n\n“Now, Tess!”\n\nHe silenced her by a kiss.', 'She was Mrs Angel Clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name?', '“These old houses are so draughty,” continued Angel, looking at the flames, and at the grease guttering down the sides.', 'It was less than a foot long, sewed up in canvas, sealed in red wax with his father’s seal, and directed in his father’s hand to “Mrs Angel Clare.”\n\n“It is a little wedding-present for you, Tess,” said he, handing it to her.', 'A heavy step was now heard in the passage, and Angel went out.', 'He and another man brought her home, thinking ’a was dead;

“I want you to tell Marian when you see her that she is to be a good woman, and not to give way to folly.', 'And you, Izzy, you have saved me by your honest words about my wife from an incredible impulse towards folly and treachery.', 'Goodbye!”\n\nHe drove on; but no sooner had Izz turned into the lane, and Clare was out of sight, than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of racking anguish; and it was with a strained unnatural face that she entered her mother’s cottage late that night.', 'Nobody ever was told how Izz spent the dark hours that intervened between Angel Clare’s parting from her and her arrival home.', 'But his sorrow was not for Izz.', 'No; it was a sense that, despite her love, as corroborated by Izz’s admission, the facts had not changed.', 'Marian had somehow heard that Tess was separated from her husband—probably through Izz Huett—and the good-natured and now tippling girl, deeming Tess in trouble, had hastened to notify to her former friend that she herself had gone to this upland spot after leaving the dairy, and would like to see her there, where there was room for other hands, if it was really true that she worked again as of old.', '“I’ll write to Izz Huett,” she said.', '“She’s biding at home doing nothing now, I know, and I’ll tell her we be here, and ask her to come;

but I am sure I can’t help it!', 'It was what he wanted Izz to do.', '“And did Izz refuse to go?” she asked.', 'Afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on which she wore it next her heart, and retained it on her finger all night, as if to fortify herself in the sensation that she was really the wife of this elusive lover of hers, who could propose that Izz should go with him abroad, so shortly after he had left her.', 'But now that she was stung to a fever by Izz’s tale, there was a limit to her powers of renunciation.', 'Marian and Izz were much interested in her excursion, knowing that the journey concerned her husband.', '“’Tis a thousand pities your husband can’t see ’ee now—you do look a real beauty!” said Izz Huett, regarding Tess as she stood on the threshold between the steely starlight without and the yellow candlelight within.', 'Izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of herself to the situation; she could not be—no woman with a heart bigger than a hazel-nut could be—antagonistic to Tess in her presence, the influence which she exercised over those of her own sex being of a warmth and strength quite unusual, curiously overpowering the less worthy feminine feelings of spite and rivalry.', 'Even Izz hoped she would win, and, though without any particular respect for her own virtue, felt glad that she had been prevented wronging her friend when momentarily tempted by Clare.', 'The woman was Izz Huett, whose interest in Tess’s excursion immediately superseded her own proceedings.', 'Tess did not explain very clearly its results, and Izz, who was a girl of tact, began to speak of her own little affair, a phase of which Tess had just witnessed.', 'But again she did not finish her effusion; he had asked Izz to go with him, and perhaps he did not care for her at all.', 'When Izz Huett and Tess arrived at the scene of operations only a rustling denoted that others had preceded them; to which, as the light increased, there were presently added the silhouettes of two men on the summit.', 'They were busily “unhaling” the rick, that is, stripping off the thatch before beginning to throw down the sheaves;

so that the feeder could seize it and spread it over the revolving drum, which whisked out every grain in one moment.', '“Who is that?” said Izz Huett to Marian.', 'She’ll see him soon enough, good-now.”\n\n“Well, I don’t think it at all right for him to join his preaching to courting a married woman, even though her husband mid be abroad, and she, in a sense, a widow.”\n\n“Oh—he can do her no harm,” said Izz drily.', 'She was the only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be shaken bodily by its spinning, and the decrease of the stack now separated her from Marian and Izz, and prevented their changing duties with her as they had done.', 'She hardly knew where she was, and did not hear Izz Huett tell her from below that her hair was tumbling down.', 'The words of Izz Huett, never quite stilled in his memory, came back to him.', 'He had asked Izz if she loved him, and she had replied in the affirmative.', 'She indirectly inquired of Amby Seedling, who had followed Izz from Talbothays, and by chance Amby remembered that, amongst the snatches of melody in which they had indulged at the dairyman’s, to induce the cows to let down their milk, Clare had seemed to like “Cupid’s Gardens”, “I have parks, I have hounds”, and “The break o’ the day”; and had seemed not to care for “The Tailor’s Breeches” and “Such a beauty I did grow”, excellent ditties as they were.', 'Tess ran down to where Marian and Izz lived, informed them of what had happened, and begged them to make the best of her case to the farmer.', '“Marian and Izz!” she cried to the girls, for it was they, sitting with the moving family at whose house they had lodged.', '“He found me.”\n\n“And do he know where you be going?”\n\n“I think so.”\n\n“Husband come back?”\n\n“No.”\n\nShe bade her acquaintance goodbye—for the respective carters had now come out from the inn—and the two waggons resumed their journey in opposite directions;

and perhaps Retty is well enough now.”\n\nTess had nothing to say against the proposal, and the next she heard of this plan for importing old Talbothays’ joys was two or three days later, when Marian informed her that Izz had replied to her inquiry, and had promised to come if she could.']

said he.', 'My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because she had brought me up “by hand.” Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand.', 'She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand.', 'Joe was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites.', 'My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap.', 'She made it a powerful merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this apron so much.', "Joe's forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the dwellings in our country were,—most of them, at that time.", 'When I ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting alone in the kitchen.', 'Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and having confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it, sitting in the chimney corner.', 'Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip.', "And she's out now, making it a baker's dozen.”\n\n“Is she?”\n\n“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what's worse, she's got Tickler with her.”\n\nAt this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire.", '“She sot down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab at Tickler, and she Ram-paged out.', "That's what she did,” said Joe, slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at it; “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”\n\n“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger species of child, and as no more than my equal.", "“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “she's been on the Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip.", 'My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open, and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and applied Tickler to its further investigation.', 'She concluded by throwing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad to get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg.', '“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe, stamping her foot.', '“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station.', "“You'll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you'd be without me!”\n\nAs she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed.", 'After that, he sat feeling his right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.', 'Then, she gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.', "I knew Mrs. Joe's housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.", 'And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe.', 'To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my untouched bread and butter on the other.', 'I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.', "Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he didn't seem to enjoy.",

head at me in very serious remonstrance.', "“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I'd recommend you to do it,” said Joe, all aghast.", "“Manners is manners, but still your elth's your elth.”\n\nBy this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe, and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily on.", "“Now, perhaps you'll mention what's the matter,” said my sister, out of breath, “you staring great stuck pig.”\n\nJoe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and looked at me again.", "“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek, and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone, “you and me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell upon you, any time.", "“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe, with his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was your age—frequent—and as a boy I've been among a many Bolters; but I never see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't Bolted dead.”\n\nMy sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying nothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”\n\nSome medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard; having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness.", 'On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be held in a bootjack.', 'Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire), “because he had had a turn.” Judging from myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had none before.', 'The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—I never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the housekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind.', '“Hark!” said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; “was that great guns, Joe?”\n\n“Ah!” said Joe.', "“There's another conwict off.”\n\n“What does that mean, Joe?” said I.\n\nMrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly, “Escaped.", "While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, “What's a convict?” Joe put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”\n\n“There was a conwict off last night,” said Joe, aloud, “after sunset-gun.", "At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, “her?” But Joe wouldn't hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide, and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it.", "Joe,” said I, as a last resort, “I should like to know—if you wouldn't much mind—where the firing comes from?”\n\n“Lord bless the boy!” exclaimed my sister, as if she didn't quite mean that but rather the contrary.", '“From the Hulks!”\n\n“Oh-h!” said I, looking at Joe.', "“Hulks!”\n\nJoe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you so.”\n\n“And please, what's Hulks?” said I.", 'It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose.', "Now, you get along to bed!”\n\nI was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,—from Mrs. Joe's thimble having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,—I felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were handy for me.", 'I had begun by asking questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.', 'As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with gray, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way, and every crack in every board calling after me, “Stop thief!” and “Get up, Mrs. Joe!” In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back was half turned, winking.', "There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe's tools.", "I knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when I was 'prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!", 'Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,—an article into which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.', "“And where the deuce ha' you been?” was Mrs. Joe's Christmas salutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.", 'well!” observed Mrs. Joe.', "“Perhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's wife, and (what's the same thing) a slave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,” said Mrs. Joe.", "“I'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and that's the best of reasons for my never hearing any.”\n\nJoe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.", 'This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.', "These extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast; “for I ain't,” said Mrs. Joe,—“I ain't a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got before me, I promise you!”\n\nSo, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser.", 'In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and uncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.', 'Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself.', 'My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that is to say, Joe and I were going.', 'In his working-clothes, Joe was a well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.', 'Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds.', 'The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done.', "Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe's uncle, but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart.", 'When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked (it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and everything most splendid.', 'Joe,” said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been all but choked, and had that moment come to, “I have brought you as the compliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry wine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.”\n\nEvery Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.', 'Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, “O, Un—cle Pum-ble—chook!', "We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like Joe's change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress.", "Joe's station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when there was company than when there was none.", 'There being plenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a pint.', 'Joe gave me some more gravy.', 'Joe gave me some more gravy.', 'Not a bit of it!”\n\nJoe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.', 'All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.', 'I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him.', 'I began to think I should get over the day, when my sister said to Joe, “Clean plates,—cold.”\n\nI clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.', "Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of having deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously, all things considered,—“Well, Mrs. Joe, we'll do our best endeavors; let us have a cut at this same pie.”\n\nMy sister went out to get it.", 'I heard Mr. Hubble remark that “a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall have some, Pip.” I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company.', "But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me, saying, “Here you are, look sharp, come on!”\n\n\nThe apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise from table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of “Gracious goodness gracious me, what's gone—with the—pie!”\n\nThe sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses.", "“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I should reply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wife's acquaintance; speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.”\n\nThis was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr. Pumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”\n\n“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time picked out Joe with his eye, “we have had an accident with these, and I find the lock of one of 'em goes wrong, and the coupling don't act pretty.", 'As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over them?”\n\nJoe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer two hours than one.', 'Not above a mile, I reckon?”\n\n“Just a mile,” said Mrs. Joe.', "If you're ready, his Majesty the King is.”\n\nJoe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather apron on, and passed into the forge.", 'Then Joe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.', 'I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality.', 'And now, when they were all in lively anticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account, poor wretches.', "At last, Joe's job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped.", 'As Joe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt.', "Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies' society; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would.", 'Joe said he was agreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved.', "We never should have got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe's curiosity to know all about it and how it ended.", 'Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and to speak no word after we reached the marshes.', "When we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan't find them.” and Joe whispered to me, “I'd give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.”\n\nWe were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day.", 'A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.', "There I was, on Joe's back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and to keep up with us.", "With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe's broad shoulder, I looked all about for any sign of the convicts.", 'To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under their breath, when Joe and I came up.', "After another moment's listening, Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge) agreed.", 'The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men should make towards it “at the double.” So we slanted to the right (where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to hold on tight to keep my seat.', 'It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he spoke all the time, “a Winder.” Down banks and up banks, and over gates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared where he went.', 'And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too.', "I had alighted from Joe's back on the brink of the ditch when we came up, and had not moved since.", "I had hold of Joe's hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches.", 'Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so we went on with the party.', "From the blacksmith's.”\n\n“Halloa!” said the sergeant, staring at Joe.", '“Halloa, Pip!” said Joe, staring at me.', "Don't you know, Pip?”\n\n“So,” said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and without the least glance at me,—“so you're the blacksmith, are you?", "Than I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.”\n\n“God knows you're welcome to it,—so far as it was ever mine,” returned Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe.", 'I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me.', 'But I loved Joe,—perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love him,—and, as to him, my inner self was not so easily composed.', 'It was much upon my mind (particularly when I first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe the whole truth.', "The fear of losing Joe's confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my tongue.", 'I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it.', "That, if Joe knew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at yesterday's meat or pudding when it came on to-day's table, without thinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry.", 'That, if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face.', 'As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took me on his back again and carried me home.', 'He must have had a tiresome journey of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad temper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself.', "Was there ever such a boy as this!” from my sister,) I found Joe telling them about the convict's confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had got into the pantry.", 'When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called “Pompeyed,” or (as I render it) pampered.', 'One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe.', 'With an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle:—\n\n There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone.', 'But I delivered this written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe received it as a miracle of erudition.', '“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what a scholar you are!', "“Why, here's a J,” said Joe, “and a O equal to anythink!", "Here's a J and a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.”\n I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right.", 'Wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, “Ah!', 'But read the rest, Jo.”\n\n“The rest, eh, Pip?” said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye, “One, two, three.', "Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three J-O, Joes in it, Pip!”\n\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole letter.", '“Astonishing!” said Joe, when I had finished.', '“You ARE a scholar.”\n\n“How do you spell Gargery, Joe?” I asked him, with a modest patronage.', "“I don't spell it at all,” said Joe.", "“But supposing you did?”\n\n“It can't be supposed,” said Joe.", "“Tho' I'm uncommon fond of reading, too.”\n\n“Are you, Joe?”\n\n“On-common.", 'Give me,” said Joe, “a good book, or a good newspaper, and sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better.', "Lord!” he continued, after rubbing his knees a little, “when you do come to a J and a O, and says you, 'Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,' how interesting reading is!”\n\nI derived from this, that Joe's education, like Steam, was yet in its infancy.", "Pursuing the subject, I inquired,—\n\n“Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”\n\n“No, Pip.”\n\n“Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”\n\n“Well, Pip,” said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars; “I'll tell you.", "And he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his anwil.—You're a listening and understanding, Pip?”\n\n“Yes, Joe.”\n\n“'Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several times; and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd say, “Joe,” she'd say, “now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,” and she'd put me to school.", "Which, you see, Pip,” said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the fire, and looking at me, “were a drawback on my learning.”\n\n“Certainly, poor Joe!”\n\n“Though mind you, Pip,” said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar, “rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his hart, don't you see?”\n\nI didn't see; but I didn't say so.", "“Well!” Joe pursued, “somebody must keep the pot a biling, Pip, or the pot won't bile, don't you know?”\n\nI saw that, and said so.", "And it were my intentions to have had put upon his tombstone that, Whatsume'er the failings on his part, Remember reader he were that good in his heart.”\n\nJoe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.", '“I made it,” said Joe, “my own self.', "She weren't long of following, poor soul, and her share of peace come round at last.”\n\nJoe's blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them, and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the round knob on the top of the poker.", '“It were but lonesome then,” said Joe, “living here alone, and I got acquainted with your sister.', 'Now, Pip,”—Joe looked firmly at me as if he knew I was not going to agree with him;—“your sister is a fine figure of a woman.”\n\nI could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.', "“Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world's opinions, on that subject may be, Pip, your sister is,” Joe tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following, “a-fine-figure—of—a—woman!”\n\nI could think of nothing better to say than “I am glad you think so, Joe.”\n\n“So am I,” returned Joe, catching me up.", '“Certainly!” assented Joe.', "As to you,” Joe pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, “if you could have been aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you'd have formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!”\n\nNot exactly relishing this, I said, “Never mind me, Joe.”\n\n“But I did mind you, Pip,” he returned with tender simplicity.", "'”\n\nI broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck: who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, “Ever the best of friends; an't us, Pip?", "Don't cry, old chap!”\n\nWhen this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:—\n\n“Well, you see, Pip, and here we are!", "Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn't see too much of what we're up to.", '“Your sister is given to government.”\n\n“Given to government, Joe?” I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea (and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a favor of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.', '“Given to government,” said Joe.', "“Which I meantersay the government of you and myself.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“And she an't over partial to having scholars on the premises,” Joe continued, “and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a scholar, for fear as I might rise.", "Like a sort of rebel, don't you see?”\n\nI was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as “Why—” when Joe stopped me.", 'At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page, Pip,” Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, “candor compels fur to admit that she is a Buster.”\n\nJoe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital Bs.', "That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?”\n\n“Yes, Joe.”\n\n“Well,” said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation; “your sister's a master-mind.", "But Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look, “Her.”\n\n“And I ain't a master-mind,” Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look, and got back to his whisker.", "I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn't no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you'll overlook shortcomings.”\n\nYoung as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that night.", 'We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my heart.', "“However,” said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; “here's the Dutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of 'em, and she's not come home yet!", "I hope Uncle Pumblechook's mare mayn't have set a forefoot on a piece o' ice, and gone down.”\n\nMrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days, to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman's judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant.", 'This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe was out on one of these expeditions.', 'Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to listen for the chaise-cart.', '“Here comes the mare,” said Joe, “ringing like a peal of bells!”\n\nThe sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual.', "We got a chair out, ready for Mrs. Joe's alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place.", 'Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.', "“Now,” said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings, “if this boy ain't grateful this night, he never will be!”\n\nI looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly uninformed why he ought to assume that expression.", 'I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows, “She?” Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and eyebrows, “She?” My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and looked at her.', 'Is the house afire?”\n\n“—Which some individual,” Joe politely hinted, “mentioned—she.”\n\n“And she is a she, I suppose?” said my sister.', "And I doubt if even you'll go so far as that.”\n\n“Miss Havisham, up town?” said Joe.", '“Well to be sure!” said Joe, astounded.', "“Who said she knew him?”\n\n“—Which some individual,” Joe again politely hinted, “mentioned that she wanted him to go and play there.”\n\n“And couldn't she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there?", 'Now Joseph, you know the case.”\n\n“No, Joseph,” said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose, “you do not yet—though you may not think it—know the case.', 'I was then delivered over to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been dying to make all along: “Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but especially unto them which brought you up by hand!”\n\n“Good-bye, Joe!”\n\n“God bless you, Pip, old chap!”\n\nI had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.', 'I determined to ask Joe why he had ever taught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called knaves.', 'I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then I should have been so too.', 'Not only that, but I felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before the contemplation of Mrs. Joe.', 'I reflected for some time, and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.”\n\nMy sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,—I had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,—when Mr. Pumblechook interposed with “No!', 'We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)\n\n“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him always; you know so well how to deal with him.”\n\n“Now, boy!', '“She was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach.”\n\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another—as they well might—and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”\n\n“Yes,” said I.', '“And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver basket.”\n\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter amazement.', '“Can this be possible, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.', "She's flighty, you know,—very flighty,—quite flighty enough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.”\n\n“Did you ever see her in it, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.", 'The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup of tea.', 'Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as regarded him,—not in the least as regarded the other two.', "Towards Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat debating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham's acquaintance and favor.", 'Joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets.', 'After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had done for the night.', 'Then I said, “Before the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to tell you something.”\n\n“Should you, Pip?” said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.', "What is it, Pip?”\n\n“Joe,” said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting it between my finger and thumb, “you remember all that about Miss Havisham's?”\n\n“Remember?” said Joe.", "Wonderful!”\n\n“It's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true.”\n\n“What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Joe, falling back in the greatest amazement.", "“You don't mean to say it's—”\n\n“Yes I do; it's lies, Joe.”\n\n“But not all of it?", "Come, Pip,” said Joe, persuasively, “if there warn't no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?”\n\n“No, Joe.”\n\n“A dog?” said Joe.", 'Come?”\n\n“No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.”\n\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.', "Where do you expect to go to?”\n\n“It's terrible, Joe; ain't it?”\n\n“Terrible?” cried Joe.", "What possessed you?”\n\n“I don't know what possessed me, Joe,” I replied, letting his shirt sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head; “but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I wish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.”\n\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.", 'This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal with as for me.', 'But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.', "“There's one thing you may be sure of, Pip,” said Joe, after some rumination, “namely, that lies is lies.", "Likewise you're a oncommon scholar.”\n\n“No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.”\n\n“Why, see what a letter you wrote last night!", "and from gentlefolks!—that I'll swear weren't wrote in print,” said Joe.", '“I have learnt next to nothing, Joe.', "It's only that.”\n\n“Well, Pip,” said Joe, “be it so or be it son't, you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope!", "The king upon his throne, with his crown upon his ed, can't sit and write his acts of Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted Prince, with the alphabet.—Ah!” added Joe, with a shake of the head that was full of meaning, “and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.", "“Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,” pursued Joe, reflectively, “mightn't be the better of continuing for to keep company with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon ones,—which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?”\n\n“No, Joe.”\n\n“(I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip).", "So don't tell no more on 'em, Pip, and live well and die happy.”\n\n“You are not angry with me, Joe?”\n\n“No, old chap.", "That's all, old chap, and don't never do it no more.”\n\nWhen I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget Joe's recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and how coarse his hands.", 'I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the level of such common doings.', 'Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there.', 'It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I merely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a stranger.', 'Joe greeted me as usual with “Halloa, Pip, old chap!” and the moment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.', 'But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of resort, I said “No, thank you, sir,” and fell into the space Joe made for me on the opposite settle.', 'The strange man, after glancing at Joe, and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg—in a very odd way, as it struck me.', '“You was saying,” said the strange man, turning to Joe, “that you was a blacksmith.”\n\n“Yes.', 'I said it, you know,” said Joe.', "You didn't mention your name, by the bye.”\n\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it.", "To top up with?”\n\n“Well,” said Joe, “to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of drinking at anybody's expense but my own.”\n\n“Habit?", "Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.”\n\n“I wouldn't wish to be stiff company,” said Joe.", '“Glasses round!”\n\n“This other gentleman,” observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle, “is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out.', "“The lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!”\n\n“That's it,” said Joe.", '“I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a solitary country towards the river.”\n\n“Most marshes is solitary,” said Joe.', 'Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or vagrants of any sort, out there?”\n\n“No,” said Joe; “none but a runaway convict now and then.', '“Once,” returned Joe.', "Didn't us, Pip?”\n\n“Yes, Joe.”\n\nThe stranger looked at me again,—still cocking his eye, as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,—and said, “He's a likely young parcel of bones that.", 'What is it you call him?”\n\n“Pip,” said Joe.', "“Christened Pip?”\n\n“No, not christened Pip.”\n\n“Surname Pip?”\n\n“No,” said Joe, “it's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant, and is called by.”\n\n“Son of yours?”\n\n“Well,” said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes,—“well—no.", '“Well,” said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, “he is not—no, not to deceive you, he is not—my nevvy.”\n\n“What the Blue Blazes is he?” asked the stranger.', 'Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe.', "I knew it to be Joe's file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the instrument.", 'There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays than at other times.', 'The half-hour and the rum and water running out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.', 'Your own.”\n\nI thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners, and holding tight to Joe.', 'He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr. Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look with his aiming eye,—no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it.', 'On the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible.', 'My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her about the bright shilling.', "“A bad un, I'll be bound,” said Mrs. Joe triumphantly, “or he wouldn't have given it to the boy!", "“But what's this?” said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper.", 'Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner.', 'Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he, Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.', "What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black night-sky, and Joe's furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road.", 'I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end.', 'And sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like “Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!”\n\nThere was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the burden was Old Clem.', 'Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I had confessed.', 'Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him.', 'In these discussions, Joe bore no part.', "But he was often talked at, while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that he was not favorable to my being taken from the forge.", 'I was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out of his hands, shake him, and put it away.', "On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a movement of her impatient fingers:—\n\n“Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.”\n\n“Joe Gargery, ma'am.”\n\n“Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?”\n\n“Yes, Miss Havisham.”\n\n“You had better be apprenticed at once.", 'Let him come soon, and come along with you.”\n\nWhen I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister “went on the Rampage,” in a more alarming degree than at any previous period.', 'She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats under our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we graciously thought she was fit for?', 'When she had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing, got out the dustpan,—which was always a very bad sign,—put on her coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent.', "It was ten o'clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and then she asked Joe why he hadn't married a Negress Slave at once?", 'Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker and looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have been a better speculation.', "It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss Havisham's.", "At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town with us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook's and called for “when we had done with our fine ladies”—a way of putting the case, from which Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst.", 'The forge was shut up for the day, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to do on the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he had taken.', "As it was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham's house.", 'Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands; as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce.', 'I followed next to her, and Joe came last.', 'When I looked back at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes.', "Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff and conducted him into Miss Havisham's presence.", '“Oh!” said she to Joe.', '“You are the husband of the sister of this boy?”\n\nI could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with his tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm.', '“You are the husband,” repeated Miss Havisham, “of the sister of this boy?”\n\nIt was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.', '“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great politeness, “as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time what you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.”\n\n“Well!” said Miss Havisham.', "“And you have reared the boy, with the intention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?”\n\n“You know, Pip,” replied Joe, “as you and me were ever friends, and it were looked for'ard to betwixt us, as being calc'lated to lead to larks.", "Does he like the trade?”\n\n“Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,” returned Joe, strengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, “that it were the wish of your own hart.” (I saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on to say) “And there weren't no objection on your part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!”\n\nIt was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he ought to speak to Miss Havisham.", "“Well, Pip, you know,” replied Joe, as if that were a little unreasonable, “you yourself see me put 'em in my 'at, and therefore you know as they are here.” With which he took them out, and gave them, not to Miss Havisham, but to me.", '“You expected,” said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, “no premium with the boy?”\n\n“Joe!” I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all.', "“Why don't you answer—”\n\n“Pip,” returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, “which I meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No.", 'Give it to your master, Pip.”\n\nAs if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass, persisted in addressing me.', '“This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,” said Joe, “and it is as such received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near, nor nowheres.', 'And now, old chap,” said Joe, conveying to me a sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham,—“and now, old chap, may we do our duty!', 'May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another, and by them which your liberal present—have-conweyed—to be—for the satisfaction of mind-of—them as never—” here Joe showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued himself with the words, “and from myself far be it!” These words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice.', 'One word!”\n\nThus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe in a distinct emphatic voice, “The boy has been a good boy here, and that is his reward.', 'Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no other and no more.”\n\nHow Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went after him and laid hold of him.', 'When we stood in the daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me, “Astonishing!” And there he remained so long saying, “Astonishing” at intervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming back.', "I have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's he invented a subtle and deep design.", "I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this, I am sure I do!”\n\n“Miss Havisham,” said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of remembrance, “made it wery partick'ler that we should give her—were it compliments or respects, Pip?”\n\n“Compliments,” I said.", "“Which that were my own belief,” answered Joe; “her compliments to Mrs. J. Gargery—”\n\n“Much good they'll do me!” observed my sister; but rather gratified too.", "“And wishing,” pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another effort of remembrance, “that the state of Miss Havisham's elth were sitch as would have—allowed, were it, Pip?”\n\n“Of her having the pleasure,” I added.", "“Of ladies' company,” said Joe.", "And what did she give young Rantipole here?”\n\n“She giv' him,” said Joe, “nothing.”\n\nMrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.", "“What she giv',” said Joe, “she giv' to his friends.", "She mayn't have know'd,” added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, “whether it were Joe, or Jorge.”\n\nMy sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden arm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all about it beforehand.", '“What would present company say to ten pound?” demanded Joe.', "Not too much, but pretty well.”\n\n“It's more than that, then,” said Joe.", 'Go on!”\n\n“What would present company say,” proceeded Joe, “to twenty pound?”\n\n“Handsome would be the word,” returned my sister.', "“Well, then,” said Joe, “It's more than twenty pound.”\n\nThat abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a patronizing laugh, “It's more than that, Mum.", "Follow her up, Joseph!”\n\n“Then to make an end of it,” said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my sister; “it's five-and-twenty pound.”\n\n“It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum,” echoed that basest of swindlers, Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; “and it's no more than your merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the money!”\n\nIf the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently awful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind.", "I said I'd see to it—to tell you the truth.”\n\nThe Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial presence.", "Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe's trade.", 'But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it.', "Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my shirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe's 'prentice, I should be distinguished and happy.", 'Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to Joe.', 'I was quite as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe while my indentures lasted.', "For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I proceed to add was Joe's.", 'It was not because I was faithful, but because Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor.', 'It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain.', "It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has touched one's self in going by, and I know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.", "Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havisham's would seem to show me Estella's face in the fire, with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,—often at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.", 'Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe.', "I wanted to make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my society and less open to Estella's reproach.", 'The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken slate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco.', 'I never knew Joe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my tuition, any piece of information whatever.', 'One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on being “most awful dull,” that I had given him up for the day, I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head.', "“Joe,” said I;

“and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.”\n\n“Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack just now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would go uptown and make a call on Miss Est—Havisham.”\n\n“Which her name,” said Joe, gravely, “ain't Estavisham, Pip, unless she have been rechris'ened.”\n\n“I know, Joe, I know.", 'What do you think of it, Joe?”\n\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of it.', 'Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick.', "When I became Joe's 'prentice, Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him;

their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.', '“Good-bye, Handel!” Herbert called out as we started.', 'So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert; I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she, quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine.', 'I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.', "Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to Herbert, “My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell you.”\n\n“My dear Handel,” he returned, “I shall esteem and respect your confidence.”\n\n“It concerns myself, Herbert,” said I, “and one other person.”\n\nHerbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side, and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I didn't go on.", '“Herbert,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee, “I love—I adore—Estella.”\n\nInstead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course way, “Exactly.', 'Well?”\n\n“Well, Herbert?', 'Well?”\n\n“What next, I mean?” said Herbert.', 'And if I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.”\n\n“Lucky for you then, Handel,” said Herbert, “that you are picked out for her and allotted to her.', "I was a blacksmith's boy but yesterday; I am—what shall I say I am—to-day?”\n\n“Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase,” returned Herbert, smiling, and clapping his hand on the back of mine—“a good fellow, with impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and dreaming, curiously mixed in him.”\n\nI stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character.", '“When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,” I went on, “I suggest what I have in my thoughts.', "And yet, when I think of Estella—”\n\n(“And when don't you, you know?” Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)", '“—Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances.', "“Now, Handel,” Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, “it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our gift-horse's mouth with a magnifying-glass.", "“I should think it was a strong point,” said Herbert, “and I should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you must bide your guardian's time, and he must bide his client's time.", '“I ought to have,” said Herbert, “for I have not much else.', '“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Herbert went on, as if we had been talking, instead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very serious.', "This may lead to miserable things.”\n\n“I know it, Herbert,” said I, with my head still turned away, “but I can't help it.”\n\n“You can't detach yourself?”\n\n“No.", "Impossible!”\n\n“Well!” said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep, and stirring the fire, “now I'll endeavor to make myself agreeable again!”\n\nSo he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about, looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left leg in both arms.", "I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father's son to remark that my father's establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping.”\n\n“There is always plenty, Herbert,” said I, to say something encouraging.", "May I ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married?”\n\nThis was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, “Is it so?”\n\n“I don't know,” said Herbert, “that's what I want to know.", "“I am,” said Herbert;

and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention engaged.', 'My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all was well down the river?', 'But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it spontaneously.', '“I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.”\n\n“Where was Clara?”\n\n“Dear little thing!” said Herbert.', "What with rum and pepper,—and pepper and rum,—I should think his pegging must be nearly over.”\n\n“And then you will be married, Herbert?”\n\n“How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?—Lay your arm out upon the back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I'll sit down here, and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes.", '“I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.”\n\n“Well!', 'Every word.”\n\nHerbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for.', "“Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.”\n\n“It seems,” said Herbert, “—there's a bandage off most charmingly, and now comes the cool one,—makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow, don't it?", 'Whom did she murder?”\n\n“Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,” said Herbert, “but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended her, and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis.', 'Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.”\n\n“Was the woman brought in guilty?”\n\n“No; she was acquitted.—My poor Handel, I hurt you!”\n\n“It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert.', 'You seem to breathe quickly.”\n\n“Perhaps I do, Herbert.', 'She did.”\n\n“That is, he says she did.”\n\n“Why, of course, my dear boy,” returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise, and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me.', "I have no other information.”\n\n“No, to be sure.”\n\n“Now, whether,” pursued Herbert, “he had used the child's mother ill, or whether he had used the child's mother well, Provis doesn't say; but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for her, and forbearance towards her.", "It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Provis's animosity.”\n\n“I want to know,” said I, “and particularly, Herbert, whether he told you when this happened?”\n\n“Particularly?", 'It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would have been about your age.”\n\n“Herbert,” said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, “can you see me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?”\n\n“By the firelight,” answered Herbert, coming close again.', '“Look at me.”\n\n“I do look at you, my dear boy.”\n\n“Touch me.”\n\n“I do touch you, my dear boy.”\n\n“You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night?”\n\n“N-no, my dear boy,” said Herbert, after taking time to examine me.', 'But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down,—that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come at the bare truth.', "Herbert's representations that, if I did, I should probably be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive's safety would depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience.", 'Early next morning we went out together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left Herbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.', "My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced Miss Havisham's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Herbert.", "This I had strongly suspected from Provis's account (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark; which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers's client until some four years later, and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity.", 'Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House were steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension of the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for a separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more settled.', 'But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home of a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told me no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join them (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the Nile and seeing wonders.', "Without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans, I felt that Herbert's way was clearing fast, and that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his daughter would soon be happily provided for.", 'On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received the following letter from Wemmick by the post.', 'Now burn.”\n\nWhen I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire—but not before we had both got it by heart—we considered what to do.', '“I have thought it over again and again,” said Herbert, “and I think I know a better course than taking a Thames waterman.', '“But how much would you tell him, Herbert?”\n\n“It is necessary to tell him very little.', 'Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations.', 'We then separated for a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary; Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings.', 'I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen Startop, and he was more than ready to join.', 'We arranged that Herbert should not come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he should prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that he should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on board.', 'Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.', "Estella's father would believe I had deserted him, would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me, when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had called at Miss Havisham's gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would never know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed through.", 'I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and Biddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.', "“I think he's all right!” said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice;

but he won't last long.", 'Mrs. Whimple confides to me that he is certainly going.”\n\n“Not to say an unfeeling thing,” said I, “he cannot do better than go.”\n\n“I am afraid that must be admitted,” said Herbert; “and then I shall come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I will walk quietly into the nearest church.', 'What a fortune for the son of my mother!”\n\nOn the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,—full of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,—as he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches.', 'On Monday morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this last vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts (that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go out to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever.', 'And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go with me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say good-bye!”\n\n\nI sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition with my creditors,—who gave me ample time to pay them in full,—and I went out and joined Herbert.', "For the beam across the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley's growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until he brought her back.", 'Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived happily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe.', "It was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to Herbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert's partnership had been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it.", 'So he told it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment.', "We owed so much to Herbert's ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all, but had been in me.", "“You must marry.”\n\n“So Herbert and Clara say, but I don't think I shall, Biddy.", "Have you paid Wemmick?”\n\n“We made the money up this morning, sir,” said one of the men, submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers's face.", 'Has Wemmick got it?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said both the men together.', 'Have you paid Wemmick?”\n\n“O yes, sir!', 'Say another word—one single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back.”\n\nThis terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.', "My hown cuthen'th gone to Mithter Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth.", 'He said it was not worth while, I was so near my destination;

“he don't mean that you should know what to make of it.—Oh!” for I looked surprised, “it's not personal; it's professional: only professional.”\n\nWemmick was at his desk, lunching—and crunching—on a dry hard biscuit; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as if he were posting them.", '“Always seems to me,” said Wemmick, “as if he had set a man-trap and was watching it.', '“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.” Pointing with his pen at the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.', "“If there was anything deeper,” added Wemmick, bringing his pen to paper, “he'd be it.”\n\nThen, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said, “Ca-pi-tal!” Then I asked if there were many clerks?", 'When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs.', '“Getting evidence together,” said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, “for the Bailey.” In the room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair (his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt me anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration, as if he had been trying his art on himself.', "When we went downstairs again, Wemmick led me into my guardian's room, and said, “This you've seen already.”\n\n“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”\n\n“These?” said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down.", "murdered his master, and, considering that he wasn't brought up to evidence, didn't plan it badly.”\n\n“Is it like him?” I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.", "You had a particular fancy for me, hadn't you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick.", '“No,” returned Wemmick.', "No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except one,—and she wasn't of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn't have caught her looking after this urn, unless there was something to drink in it.” Wemmick's attention being thus directed to his brooch, he put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief.", "“He has the same look.”\n\n“You're right,” said Wemmick; “it's the genuine look.", 'You were a gentlemanly Cove, though” (Mr. Wemmick was again apostrophizing), “and you said you could write Greek.', 'I never met such a liar as you!” Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said, “Sent out to buy it for me, only the day before.”\n\nWhile he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair, the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources.', "Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?”\n\n“Not yet.”\n\n“Well,” said Wemmick, “he'll give you wine, and good wine.", "When you go to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.”\n\n“Shall I see something very uncommon?”\n\n“Well,” said Wemmick, “you'll see a wild beast tamed.", 'I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening.', "“Certainly,” said I, “if you approve.”\n\n“Very much,” was Wemmick's reply, “for I have had my legs under the desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them.", "And there's another rum thing in his house,” proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood;

comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation,—upon which Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, “every one of 'em Lies, sir.” These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.", 'Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him cleaning my boots.', 'By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened into a post-office again.', "It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian's establishment with that of his cashier and clerk.", 'My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth;

how do you find yourself?” Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers,—always singly,—Wemmick with his post-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.", "In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced, said, “it's no use, my boy.", "Now, who's next?”\n\nThus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until he turned to me and said, “Notice the man I shall shake hands with.” I should have done so, without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.", "“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?”\n\n“All right, Mr. Wemmick.”\n\n“Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong for us, Colonel.”\n\n“Yes, it was too strong, sir,—but I don't care.”\n\n“No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “you don't care.” Then, turning to me, “Served His Majesty this man.", '“I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,” he said to Wemmick.', "“Perhaps,” returned my friend, “but there's no knowing.”\n\n“I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,” said the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.", '“Thankye,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him.', "“Same to you, Colonel.”\n\n“If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,” said the man, unwilling to let his hand go, “I should have asked the favor of your wearing another ring—in acknowledgment of your attentions.”\n\n“I'll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick.", "Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair, if you've no further use for 'em?”\n\n“It shall be done, sir.”\n\n“All right,” said Wemmick, “they shall be taken care of.", 'Good-bye!” They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workman.', "“Well, Mr. Wemmick,” said the turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates, and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, “what's Mr. Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder?", "Is he going to make it manslaughter, or what's he going to make of it?”\n\n“Why don't you ask him?” returned Wemmick.", "“Now, that's the way with them here, Mr. Pip,” remarked Wemmick, turning to me with his post-office elongated.", "“They don't mind what they ask of me, the subordinate; but you'll never catch 'em asking any questions of my principal.”\n\n“Is this young gentleman one of the 'prentices or articled ones of your office?” asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick's humor.", '“There he goes again, you see!” cried Wemmick, “I told you so!', "Well, supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?”\n\n“Why then,” said the turnkey, grinning again, “he knows what Mr. Jaggers is.”\n\n“Yah!” cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way, “you're dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal, you know you are.", "“Mind you, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm to be more confidential; “I don't know that Mr. Jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high.", "Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where suppliants for Mr. Jaggers's notice were lingering about as usual, and I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three hours on hand.", 'I wished that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes.', "So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick's conservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me.", 'On the day before it, I received an official note from Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day.', 'In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissue-paper that I liked the look of.', 'Ask another.”\n\n“Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?”\n\n“Waive that, a moment,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and ask another.”\n\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry, “Have-I—anything to receive, sir?” On that, Mr. Jaggers said, triumphantly, “I thought we should come to it!” and called to Wemmick to give him that piece of paper.', 'Wemmick appeared, handed it in, and disappeared.', "You have been drawing pretty freely here;

but that is your fault, in having ever brought me here.”\n\nWemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of start, “Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing.", "“Ecod,” replied Wemmick, shaking his head, “that's not my trade.”\n\n“Nor is this your trading-place,” said I.", "I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins's arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick.", 'Then, she put on her gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now, Aged Parent, tip us the paper.”\n\nWemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud.', "“I won't offer an apology,” said Wemmick, “for he isn't capable of many pleasures—are you, Aged P.?”\n\n“All right, John, all right,” returned the old man, seeing himself spoken to.", "“Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,” said Wemmick, “and he'll be as happy as a king.", 'But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on, quite unconscious of his many rescues.', "As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins's waist.", "By and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and gradually fading out of view.", "Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading, Wemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by Miss Skiffins.", 'This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect.', 'Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and Wemmick drank out of one glass.', 'Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth, stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would be glad if I could come and see him again upon it.', 'Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.', 'Why, Wemmick.”\n\nI could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life.', "There's Jaggers, and there's Wemmick, and there's you.", '“I have been informed by Wemmick,” pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking hard at me, “that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of the name of Purvis, or—”\n\n“Or Provis,” I suggested.', 'Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by return of post.', 'I turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open, and to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a man he is!”\n\nWemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me.', "It was directed to Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the words, “PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.” I opened it, the watchman holding up his light, and read inside, in Wemmick's writing,—\n\n“DON'T GO HOME.”\n\n\n\n\nTurning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden.", 'I had left directions that I was to be called at seven;

and I told him how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or prisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had said about getting him abroad.', "I added, that of course, when the time came, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might be safest in Wemmick's judgment.", "Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick's suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue.", 'We waited for Wemmick, and he made no sign.', 'But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his hint.', "“You don't mind admitting that, I suppose?”\n\n“No,” I returned, “I don't mind admitting that.”\n\n“And are not engaged?”\n\n“I don't mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”\n\n“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”\n\nI was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick's coming.” So I changed my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered, serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon's bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.", "Although I should not have thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much as a look to Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way.", 'He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.', "“Did you send that note of Miss Havisham's to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?” Mr. Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.", '“No, sir,” returned Wemmick;

“it happened—happened, don't you see?—that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look.", 'As to this case, if you will have scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?” “To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr.', 'Jaggers was altogether too many for the jury, and they gave in.”\n\n“Has she been in his service ever since?”\n\n“Yes;

but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to compromise him.", 'Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.', "Mr. Jaggers's eyes retired a little deeper into his head when I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick, with instructions to draw the check for his signature.", 'While that was in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr. Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked on at me.', "And I saw Wemmick's lips form the words “portable property.”\n\n“I should not have told her No, if I had been you,” said Mr Jaggers;

if you are lost, your child is still saved.” Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was cleared.”\n\n“I understand you perfectly.”\n\n“But that I make no admissions?”\n\n“That you make no admissions.” And Wemmick repeated, “No admissions.”\n\n“Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the woman's intellects, and that when she was set at liberty, she was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be sheltered.", 'Put that last case to yourself very carefully.”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“I ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully.”\n\nAnd Wemmick said, “I do.”\n\n“For whose sake would you reveal the secret?', "But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her the subject of those 'poor dreams' which have, at one time or another, been in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you that you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well of it—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off too.”\n\nI looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave.", '“Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, “what item was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?”\n\nStanding by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other.', 'For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment.', "As he imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike's eye happened to twinkle with a tear.", '“What are you about?” demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.', "“What do you come snivelling here for?”\n\n“I didn't go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.”\n\n“You did,” said Wemmick.", "What do you mean by it?”\n\n“A man can't help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,” pleaded Mike.", '“His what?” demanded Wemmick, quite savagely.', 'Get out.”\n\n“It serves you right,” said Wemmick, “Get out.”\n\nSo, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch.', 'On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received the following letter from Wemmick by the post.', "That, coming on Wemmick's letter and the morning's busy preparation, turned the scale.", 'The morning hurry and flutter had been great;

pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply revolving that I was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse; that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived bad way.", "When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss Havisham's, and asked a number of questions.", "I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham's as my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood.", 'Not only that, but I felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood;

she was still very ill, though considered something better.', "Estella's father would believe I had deserted him, would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me, when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had called at Miss Havisham's gate for only a moment;

having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness.", "While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, “What's a convict?” Joe put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”\n\n“There was a conwict off last night,” said Joe, aloud, “after sunset-gun.", 'I heard Mr. Hubble remark that “a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall have some, Pip.” I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company.', "When we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan't find them.” and Joe whispered to me, “I'd give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.”\n\nWe were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day.", '“Halloa, Pip!” said Joe, staring at me.', "Don't you know, Pip?”\n\n“So,” said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and without the least glance at me,—“so you're the blacksmith, are you?", "“We don't know what you have done, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor miserable fellow-creatur.—Would us, Pip?”\n\nThe something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man's throat again, and he turned his back.", '“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what a scholar you are!', "Here's a J and a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.”\n I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right.", 'But read the rest, Jo.”\n\n“The rest, eh, Pip?” said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye, “One, two, three.', "Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three J-O, Joes in it, Pip!”\n\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole letter.", "Pursuing the subject, I inquired,—\n\n“Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”\n\n“No, Pip.”\n\n“Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”\n\n“Well, Pip,” said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars; “I'll tell you.", 'My father, Pip, he were given to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my mother, most onmerciful.', "And he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his anwil.—You're a listening and understanding, Pip?”\n\n“Yes, Joe.”\n\n“'Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several times;

but I told poor Biddy everything.', 'Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though I think I know now.', 'Not, however, until Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little catalogue of prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a half-penny.', "Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.", "It may have been about a month after my sister's reappearance in the kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.", 'Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me every now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, “Such a fine figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!” Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life, and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did him good.', "Biddy's first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me.", 'When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate.', 'Biddy looked thoughtfully at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.', '“Why, of course!” cried Biddy, with an exultant face.', 'Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however.', 'It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at—writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagem—and seeing Biddy observant of what I was about.', 'I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down.', '“Biddy,” said I, “how do you manage it?', "I don't know,” returned Biddy, smiling.", '“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I learn, and always to keep up with me?” I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.', '“I might as well ask you,” said Biddy, “how you manage?”\n\n“No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see me turning to at it.', 'But you never turn to at it, Biddy.”\n\n“I suppose I must catch it like a cough,” said Biddy, quietly; and went on with her sewing.', 'Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather an extraordinary girl.', 'In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew.', '“You are one of those, Biddy,” said I, “who make the most of every chance.', 'You never had a chance before you came here, and see how improved you are!”\n\nBiddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing.', '“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement.', '“Why, you are crying!”\n\n“No I am not,” said Biddy, looking up and laughing.', 'I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of course.', 'Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy.', '“Yes, Biddy,” I observed, when I had done turning it over, “you were my first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this, in this kitchen.”\n\n“Ah, poor thing!” replied Biddy.', 'Let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.”\n\nMy sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook the care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out together.', 'When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.', "“Biddy,” said I, after binding her to secrecy, “I want to be a gentleman.”\n\n“O, I wouldn't, if I was you!” she returned.", "“I don't think it would answer.”\n\n“Biddy,” said I, with some severity, “I have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentleman.”\n\n“You know best, Pip; but don't you think you are happier as you are?”\n\n“Biddy,” I exclaimed, impatiently, “I am not at all happy as I am.", "Don't be absurd.”\n\n“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; “I am sorry for that; I didn't mean to be.", "I only want you to do well, and to be comfortable.”\n\n“Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now.”\n\n“That's a pity!” said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.", 'Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own.', '“If I could have settled down,” I said to Biddy, plucking up the short grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,—“if I could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was little, I know it would have been much better for me.', "I should have been good enough for you; shouldn't I, Biddy?”\n\nBiddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for answer, “Yes; I am not over-particular.” It scarcely sounded flattering, but I knew she meant well.", 'Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and—what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me so!”\n\nBiddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.', '“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?” Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.', '“Because, if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but you know best—that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words.', '“It may be all quite true,” said I to Biddy, “but I admire her dreadfully.”\n\nIn short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well.', 'Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.', '“I am glad of one thing,” said Biddy, “and that is, that you have felt you could give me your confidence, Pip.', "But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her, and it's of no use now.” So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, “Shall we walk a little farther, or go home?”\n\n“Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving her a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.”\n\n“Till you're a gentleman,” said Biddy.", 'Not that I have any occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,—as I told you at home the other night.”\n\n“Ah!” said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.', 'And then repeated, with her former pleasant change, “shall we walk a little farther, or go home?”\n\nI said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very beautiful.', 'I asked myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?', 'I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, “Pip, what a fool you are!”\n\nWe talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed right.', 'Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and somebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no pleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine.', '“Biddy,” said I, when we were walking homeward, “I wish you could put me right.”\n\n“I wish I could!” said Biddy.', "“If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,—you don't mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?”\n\n“Oh dear, not at all!” said Biddy.", "“Don't mind me.”\n\n“If I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me.”\n\n“But you never will, you see,” said Biddy.", 'But Biddy said she was, and she said it decisively.', "Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper, “Don't let him come; I don't like him.” As I did not like him either, I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn't want seeing home.", 'Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account, I asked her why she did not like him.', '“No,” said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, “he never told me so; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.”\n\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation.', '“But it makes no difference to you, you know,” said Biddy, calmly.', "“No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don't like it; I don't approve of it.”\n\n“Nor I neither,” said Biddy.", '“Though that makes no difference to you.”\n\n“Exactly,” said I; “but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.”\n\nI kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances were favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that demonstration.', 'And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness.', 'At those times, I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter my wits again.', "Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another?”\n\nI had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt; so, I replied in the negative.", 'My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at her needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe in the corner opposite my sister.', "At length I got out, “Joe, have you told Biddy?”\n\n“No, Pip,” returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his knees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere, “which I left it to yourself, Pip.”\n\n“I would rather you told, Joe.”\n\n“Pip's a gentleman of fortun' then,” said Joe, “and God bless him in it!”\n\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me.", 'I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with the grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune.', "Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining his knees, said, “Ay, ay, I'll be ekervally partickler, Pip;” and then they congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that I didn't half like it.", 'Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened.', 'She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and “Property.” But I doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.', 'I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.', 'And whenever I caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they often looked at me,—particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they were expressing some mistrust of me.', "“They'll soon go.”\n\n“Soon, soon go,” said Biddy.", "“If you couldn't abear yourself—”\n\nBiddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister's plate, “Have you thought about when you'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister and me?", "You will show yourself to us; won't you?”\n\n“Biddy,” I returned with some resentment, “you are so exceedingly quick that it's difficult to keep up with you.”\n\n(“She always were quick,” observed Joe.)", '“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,—most likely on the evening before I go away.”\n\nBiddy said no more.', "It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.", 'As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and light it for him.', 'He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his pipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew that they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once.', 'Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did.', 'He was so perfectly innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in preference.', 'So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never forget her, said I had a favor to ask of her.', '“And it is, Biddy,” said I, “that you will not omit any opportunity of helping Joe on, a little.”\n\n“How helping him on?” asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.', 'For instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.”\n\nAlthough I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.', "won't his manners do then?” asked Biddy, plucking a black-currant leaf.", '“My dear Biddy, they do very well here—”\n\n“O!', 'they do very well here?” interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the leaf in her hand.', "“Hear me out,—but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would hardly do him justice.”\n\n“And don't you think he knows that?” asked Biddy.", 'It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,—\n\n“Biddy, what do you mean?”\n\nBiddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and the smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, “Have you never considered that he may be proud?”\n\n“Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.', 'there are many kinds of pride,” said Biddy, looking full at me and shaking her head; “pride is not all of one kind—”\n\n“Well?', '“Not all of one kind,” resumed Biddy.', 'To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it sounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I do.”\n\n“Now, Biddy,” said I, “I am very sorry to see this in you.', 'You are envious, Biddy, and grudging.', "You are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can't help showing it.”\n\n“If you have the heart to think so,” returned Biddy, “say so.", "Say so over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.”\n\n“If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,” said I, in a virtuous and superior tone; “don't put it off upon me.", 'I am extremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,” I repeated.', "“It's a—it's a bad side of human nature.”\n\n“Whether you scold me or approve of me,” returned poor Biddy, “you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at all times.", 'Yet a gentleman should not be unjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away her head.', 'I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.', 'But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to Biddy, and we dropped the subject.', 'As the six evenings had dwindled away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy.', 'Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.', 'After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy called to me that I was late.', "I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy, and threw my arms around Joe's neck.", 'The last I saw of them was, when I presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe.', 'I stopped then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to her face.', 'On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had left Joe and Biddy.', "And Biddy, she's ever right and ready.", '“Biddy,” pursued Joe, “when I got home and asked her fur to write the message to you, a little hung back.', "Biddy says, 'I know he will be very glad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see him, go!'", 'My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy.', 'Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly here and there, and was very helpful.', 'When I had spoken to Biddy, as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and there began to wonder in what part of the house it—she—my sister—was.', 'We are ready!”\n\nSo we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble.', 'Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great restraint upon us.', 'When the shadows of evening were closing in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk.', '“Biddy,” said I, “I think you might have written to me about these sad matters.”\n\n“Do you, Mr. Pip?” said Biddy.', "“I should have written if I had thought that.”\n\n“Don't suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider that you ought to have thought that.”\n\n“Do you, Mr. Pip?”\n\nShe was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again.", '“I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?”\n\n“Oh!', "I can't do so, Mr. Pip,” said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction.", 'I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.”\n\n“How are you going to live, Biddy?', 'If you want any mo—”\n\n“How am I going to live?” repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary flush upon her face.', 'You know, Mr. Pip,” pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, “the new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after that time, and have had time since then to improve.”\n\n“I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.”\n\n“Ah!', 'Except in my bad side of human nature,” murmured Biddy.', 'So, I walked a little further with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.', "“I have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy.”\n\n“They are very slight, poor thing.", 'And so she never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.”\n\nBiddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.', '“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”\n\n“I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries.”\n\n“Of course you have seen him then?—Why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane?”\n\n“I saw him there, on the night she died.”\n\n“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”\n\n“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.—It is of no use,” said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running out, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and he is gone.”\n\nIt revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him.', '“Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,” said I; “and Biddy, we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down here now.', 'I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.”\n\nBiddy said never a single word.', "“Biddy, don't you hear me?”\n\n“Yes, Mr. Pip.”\n\n“Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,—which appears to me to be in bad taste, Biddy,—what do you mean?”\n\n“What do I mean?” asked Biddy, timidly.", '“Biddy,” said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, “I must request to know what you mean by this?”\n\n“By this?” said Biddy.', '“You used not to echo, Biddy.”\n\n“Used not!” said Biddy.', '“Biddy,” said I, “I made a remark respecting my coming down here often, to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence.', 'Have the goodness, Biddy, to tell me why.”\n\n“Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?” asked Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye.', '“O dear me!” said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair.', "Don't say any more, if you please, Biddy.", 'This shocks me very much.”\n\nFor which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day.', 'As often as I was restless in the night, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.', "“Good-bye, dear Joe!—No, don't wipe it off—for God's sake, give me your blackened hand!—I shall be down soon and often.”\n “Never too soon, sir,” said Joe, “and never too often, Pip!”\n\nBiddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread.", "“Biddy,” said I, when I gave her my hand at parting, “I am not angry, but I am hurt.”\n\n“No, don't be hurt,” she pleaded quite pathetically; “let only me be hurt, if I have been ungenerous.”\n\nOnce more, the mists were rising as I walked away.", 'If they disclosed to me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy was quite right, all I can say is,—they were quite right too.', 'I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to Biddy now, for any consideration;

and when he gave out the psalm,—always giving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say, “You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this style!”\n\nI opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit of ours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook.', "I remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble,—I don't know at what remote period,—when she was much younger than he.", 'Mr. Wopsle said grace with theatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like a religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.', 'Be grateful.”\n\n“Especially,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “be grateful, boy, to them which brought you up by hand.”\n\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, “Why is it that the young are never grateful?” This moral mystery seemed too much for the company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, “Naterally wicious.” Everybody then murmured “True!” and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner.', 'A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being “thrown open”—what kind of sermon he would have given them.', "A man needn't go far to find a subject, if he's ready with his salt-box.” Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short interval of reflection, “Look at Pork alone.", 'Many a moral for the young,” returned Mr. Wopsle,—and I knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; “might be deduced from that text.”\n\n(“You listen to this,” said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)', '“Swine,” pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,—“swine were the companions of the prodigal.', '“What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.”\n\n“Or girl,” suggested Mr. Hubble.', "“Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,” assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably, “but there is no girl present.”\n\n“Besides,” said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, “think what you've got to be grateful for.", '“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mr. Pumblechook.', 'Not you—”\n\n“Unless in that form,” said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.', "“But I don't mean in that form, sir,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had an objection to being interrupted; “I mean, enjoying himself with his elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and rolling in the lap of luxury.", "Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it until he howled.", "“Yet,” said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed, “Pork—regarded as biled—is rich, too; ain't it?”\n\n“Have a little brandy, uncle,” said my sister.", 'Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding.', 'The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water.', 'I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife.', 'I saw reawakening appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle.', 'I heard Mr. Hubble remark that “a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall have some, Pip.” I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company.', "“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I should reply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wife's acquaintance; speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.”\n\nThis was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr. Pumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”\n\n“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time picked out Joe with his eye, “we have had an accident with these, and I find the lock of one of 'em goes wrong, and the coupling don't act pretty.", '“Would you give me the time?” said the sergeant, addressing himself to Mr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he was equal to the time.', "That'll do.”\n\n“Convicts, sergeant?” asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.", 'But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, “Give him wine, Mum.', '“Good stuff, eh, sergeant?” said Mr. Pumblechook.', "“I'll tell you something,” returned the sergeant;

but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would.", "As it was, she merely stipulated, “If you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don't look to me to put it together again.”\n\nThe sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr. Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman's merits under arid conditions, as when something moist was going.", 'Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and to speak no word after we reached the marshes.', "There I was, on Joe's back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and to keep up with us.", 'Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his blowing and hard breathing;

but, as he had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously set at naught,—not to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.', "Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it.", 'She rented a small cottage, and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally bumping on the ceiling.', 'There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle “examined” the scholars once a quarter.', "This was always followed by Collins's Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look.", "Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution, kept in the same room—a little general shop.", "Biddy was Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter;

but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.', "“What's all this?” said Mr. Jaggers.", "“If I don't bring 'em here, what does it matter?”\n\n“Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling openly, “this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.”\n\n“Not a bit of it,” returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder.", '“You with a pleasant home?” said Mr. Jaggers.', "Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn't wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days, when you're tired of all this work.”\n\nMr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and actually drew a sigh.", '“Now, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “put this case.', 'Mr. Jaggers did the same.', '“Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, “what item was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?”\n\nStanding by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other.', 'For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment.', "As he imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike's eye happened to twinkle with a tear.", "“What do you come snivelling here for?”\n\n“I didn't go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.”\n\n“You did,” said Wemmick.", "What do you mean by it?”\n\n“A man can't help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,” pleaded Mike.", '“Say that again!”\n\n“Now look here my man,” said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing to the door.', 'Get out.”\n\n“It serves you right,” said Wemmick, “Get out.”\n\nSo, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch.', '“Mr.', "I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing.", 'I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth.', 'Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having “let it slip through my fingers,” and said we must memorialize by and by, and try at all events for some of it.', 'Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr. Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit.', "His ignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.", "You don't blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip?", 'While he was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up to it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,—\n\n“What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?”\n\n“Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.”\n\n“These twelve years, more likely,” said Wemmick.', '“I know your engagements,” said he, “and I know you are out of sorts, Mr. Pip.', '“Now, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came out, “let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a wedding-party!”\n\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity.', 'I say, Mr. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low.', '“After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may as well not know of it.', 'When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions.', 'But she had wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket.', "When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord.", 'Mr. Pumblechook (not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms:—\n\n“Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low.', '“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, “put a muffin on table.', 'Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.', '“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on.', "William, bring a watercress.”\n\n“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I don't eat watercresses.”\n\n“You don't eat 'em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall.", "You needn't bring any, William.”\n\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.", '“Little more than skin and bone!” mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud.']

the vehicle whereon sat Marian, Izz, and the ploughman’s family with whom they had thrown in their lot, being brightly painted, and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass ornaments on their harness;

but lyrically, dramatically, and even historically, I am tenderly attached to them.”\n\nThis distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too subtle for Mr Clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had been about to relate; which was that after the death of the senior so-called d’Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable passions, though he had a blind mother, whose condition should have made him know better.', 'Don’t you know them, Tess?—‘And she shall follow after her lover, but she shall not overtake him;

“but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I wish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.”\n\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.", "The last Hamlet as I dressed, made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal (which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out “I don't see no wafers!” And at night his reading was lovely.”\n\nMr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say “a faithful Dependent—I overlook his folly;” and then said aloud, “My view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here;

whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss Havisham was consuming within it,—these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on my bed.', '“Or,” said Estella,—“which is a nearer case,—if you had taught her, from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might, that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had blighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then, for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”\n\nMiss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her face), but still made no answer.', "“You don't mind admitting that, I suppose?”\n\n“No,” I returned, “I don't mind admitting that.”\n\n“And are not engaged?”\n\n“I don't mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”\n\n“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”\n\nI was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick's coming.” So I changed my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered, serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon's bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.", 'At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.', '“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”\n\n“I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries.”\n\n“Of course you have seen him then?—Why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane?”\n\n“I saw him there, on the night she died.”\n\n“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”\n\n“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.—It is of no use,” said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running out, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and he is gone.”\n\nIt revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him.', '“And that same man, remember,” pursued the gentleman, throwing his finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,—“that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help him God!”\n\nWe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time.', "“You don't mind admitting that, I suppose?”\n\n“No,” I returned, “I don't mind admitting that.”\n\n“And are not engaged?”\n\n“I don't mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”\n\n“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”\n\nI was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick's coming.” So I changed my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered, serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon's bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall."]
